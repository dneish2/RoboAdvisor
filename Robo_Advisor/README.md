## Why Risky?

Legacy tools like **Option Profit Calculator** or **Optionista** are often static, requiring extensive manual data entry for single-point calculations. These tools can fall short in providing actionable guidance for long-term asset acquisition.

**Risky** changes the game by integrating an **Investment Thesis** that functions as a dynamic advisor. This distilled knowledge repository guides asset selection and acquisition based on historical data and projected performance, offering strategic insights that legacy tools can’t match.
