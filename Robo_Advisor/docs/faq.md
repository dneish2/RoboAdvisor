### Options 101: Common Questions

#### **1. What is an options contract?**

An options contract is a financial instrument that gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset (such as a stock) at a specific price within a defined period. There are two types:
   - **Call Option**: The right to buy a stock at a set price before a specific date.
   - **Put Option**: The right to sell a stock at a set price before a specific date.

#### **2. Why do investors use options?**

Options can be used for several strategies, including:
   - **Hedging**: Protecting a portfolio against losses by using options as a form of insurance.
   - **Speculation**: Making bets on the direction of stock prices with potentially high returns (and high risk).
   - **Income Generation**: Selling options (like covered calls) to generate additional income on assets already owned.

#### **3. What are the main risks of options trading?**

Options trading can be risky, as the potential for loss can be substantial, especially when engaging in complex strategies or if the stock moves against the intended direction. Unlike buying stock, options can expire worthless, resulting in a total loss of the premium paid.

#### **4. How can the Robo-Advisor help with options trading?**

This app assists users by:
   - Providing data visualization on options performance to aid in strategic decisions.
