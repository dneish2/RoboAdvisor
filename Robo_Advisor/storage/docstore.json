Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the \nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \nenvironment for all of its team members.

The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \nvariety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees\u2019 \nindividual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities \nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \nenvironments.

Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize \nfrom time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \nand adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, \npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition .\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including \nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher \ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely \naffect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially \nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset \nvalues, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global \nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial \ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the \nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced \nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, \nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents \nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material \nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular \nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4037, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c99f4b34-347e-4256-bbec-b9f2ec5040f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c99f4b34-347e-4256-bbec-b9f2ec5040f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "49aa8cdff14d4982a189408e936b82a966adb5c49dc69e320cb7f299f3f5b23e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "379a5371-c8e0-4e6b-8bf0-534488ecd2a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e575129faa70aee3dfd345551e10177b8bd4dd6ac35e5fa46c3cb4084148f0f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, \nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to \noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures \napply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply \nchain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, \nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s \noperations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and \ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company \nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If \ndisputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and \nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other \ninternational disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and \nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial \naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health \nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate \nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more \nfrequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and \ndeliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result \nin slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in \naffected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience \nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete \nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on \nits\u00a0 intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \nCompany\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications \nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also \nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their \nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and \nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models \nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content \nand applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to \ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.

The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new \ntechnologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective \nmanagement of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products \nin appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may \nhave quality or other defects or deficiencies.

Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of \ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \ndisputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade \ndisputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of \nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, \nwhich can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s \nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional \neconomic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition ,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain \ncomponents . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can \nmaterially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing \ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has \nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business \nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \ndefects.

Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, \nand result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for \nproducts and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4564, "end_char_idx": 6654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7de3d53-b7c6-4898-888f-5e7b1d6814c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7de3d53-b7c6-4898-888f-5e7b1d6814c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "39ae3b413ab0d8de1e3bb9b0a875e2185dbdd389efe1665418d990158c11de46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase \ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated \ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \nsuppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \nin the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \nperiods up to 150 days . Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently \ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the \nCompany\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to \ntime, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. \nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally \nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such \nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or \notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party \nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain \nsoftware applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be \ndeveloped and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the \ndevelopers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services \nfor the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for \npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on \nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected \nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers \nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to \ndeveloping and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on \nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its \nproducts. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party \ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these \nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower \ncustomer demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5534, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "834b2303-52a1-41cc-a397-c80d244354c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "834b2303-52a1-41cc-a397-c80d244354c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "3397c61941c7054d5f21fe151425b5aa6e12d3a4ddf895bce82bd5eeea28ed33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16ab2475-d4bb-4092-8b73-2e6cf27a1286", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52734babc3088024dd16c8c90a2dfe070a21d34bc0453a85dfcfa321349a1c14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, \ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of \napplications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made \nchanges to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory \nrequirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives \nimpacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with \nby March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in \nchanges to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how \ndevelopers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes \ncould also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside \nof the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store \nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company \nearns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is \notherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available \non commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or \noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. \nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the \ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers \nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or \nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may \nseek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a \nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for \ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. \nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.

Future changes could also \naffect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App \nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding \nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4301, "end_char_idx": 6069, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e041f4cf-0ef5-4e65-9269-a8d78d89dc4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e041f4cf-0ef5-4e65-9269-a8d78d89dc4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "19b192dcb5b748fcab0bbd432d4675f24e78f693a30a4de1c868e0cd4cce740d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in \nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact \non the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of \ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse \nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its \nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s \nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other \ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are \ncurrently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by \nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s \nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively \nimpact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users \nof the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor \nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations \nregarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, \nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party \ntransactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several \njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have \nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with \nemerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future \nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information \nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to \ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations \ncould result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational \nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance \nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, \nresults of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5658, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfef548d-3e92-4e49-bd88-1c66a619b541": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfef548d-3e92-4e49-bd88-1c66a619b541", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "159d19cfc4f00924eba239e9a5384af92610f8ca8ed6924d9f5dba8069ffd70b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Financial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \nacquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost \nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that \ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be \nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a \nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are \nin place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company \nhas not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value \ncould result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5212, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99170a52-bd66-415f-83c0-238c77ca72ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "99170a52-bd66-415f-83c0-238c77ca72ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "70711fff9abcc5eb075c4c62210d5c808a50a2702f75003f4fa3605285788fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not \ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \nCompany\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to \ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \ncomponents. As of September\u00a030, 2023 , the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \nnumber of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income \ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the \nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings \nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of \nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant \njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \noutcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the \nCompany\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of \noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating \nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \nexceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \nsubject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it \nto acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, \ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which \ncould have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.

(\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) \nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the \nCompany\u2019s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to \nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store \nReview Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting \ndevelopers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app \npurchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and \nEpic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied \nboth petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\u2019s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple\u2019s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc.

In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to \nthe United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC \nentered a limited exclusion order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with \nblood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the \nend of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023.

\ncompensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023  was lower compared to 2022  due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign \nearnings

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio \nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase \nthe interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \ninstruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a030, 2023  and \nSeptember\u00a024, 2022  (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive InstrumentHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 \nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \nCompany\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \nvalues of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \nprohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 \nmillion and $1.0 billion as of September\u00a030, 2023  and September\u00a024, 2022 , respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying \nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \nCompany\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 26", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5d3fe84-78e8-430b-aee2-2af7fc9c5d1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5d3fe84-78e8-430b-aee2-2af7fc9c5d1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "48c91a1684e52f50618a3fefdef7fbde40fec785b23ebde4b36ca6f036132053", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s \nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over \ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). \nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three  performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, \nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated \nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to \nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the \nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative \nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \nbased on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the \nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis \nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \nnet sales only the commission it retains.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4151e680-d44f-4481-bee9-32337d0f73e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4151e680-d44f-4481-bee9-32337d0f73e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "33397a19e3211f7b265b0236a696a891b805f23537d6813a22d3c06d2e9d8e81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Net sales disaggregated b y significant products  and services for 2023 , 2022  and 2021  were as follows (in millions):\n2023 2022 2021\niPhone (1)$ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 \nMac (1) 29,357  40,177  35,190 \niPad (1) 28,300  29,292  31,862 \nWearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845  41,241  38,367 \nServices (2) 85,200  78,129  68,425 \nTotal net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 \n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in \nthe sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales includ e $8.2 billion  of revenue recognized in 2023  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a024, \n2022 , $7.5 billion  of revenue recognized in 2022  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a025, 2021 , and $6.7 \nbillion  of revenue recognized in 2021  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a026, 2020 .\nThe Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \nin Note 13, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data \u201d for 2023 , 2022  and 2021 , except in Greater China, where iPhone \nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023  and September\u00a024, 2022 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion  and $12.4\u00a0billion , \nrespectively.

The \nCompany classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument\u2019s underlying \ncontractual maturity date.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. \nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations \nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a \nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other \ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its \nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months .\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 46", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3215, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14879d55-75de-4bea-be84-5eeaaae02231": {"__data__": {"id_": "14879d55-75de-4bea-be84-5eeaaae02231", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "04e9e15978bc93f31616b7513d99651bcd7efe3832f3bc78042ec287b4a2c201", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined \nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00a0 30, 2023  to provide reasonable \nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is \n(i)\u00a0 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and \n(ii)\u00a0 accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal \nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s \ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s \nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\u00a030, 2023  \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit \nreport on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023 , which were \nidentified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the \nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over \nfinancial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 52", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4635, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "216286d9-bc81-4d90-9277-f2e3edc7eb9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "216286d9-bc81-4d90-9277-f2e3edc7eb9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_55", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-09"}, "hash": "3dcc441ff6cbe5c088bf2851e6f814e055c837b24e1aeca2dffbb320c74e105c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 9B.

We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing\nwafers, reticles/masks, chemicals/materials, integrated circuits (\u201cIC\u201d or \u201cchip\u201d), packaged ICs and printed circuit boards (\u201cPCB\u201d), as well as comprehensive support and services\nacross our installed base. Our suite of advanced products, coupled with our unique process control software and services, allow us to deliver the solutions our customers need to\nachieve their technology advancement and high volume production goals by significantly improving yields, while simultaneously reducing waste, risks and costs. This improves our\ncustomers\u2019 overall profitability and return on investment.\nKLA was formed as KLA-Tencor Corporation in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the\nsemiconductor capital equipment industry that began operations in 1975 and 1976, respectively. We are organized into three reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control;\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB and Component Inspection.\nWithin the Semiconductor Process Control segment, our comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and software products, as well as related services, help IC, wafer,\nreticle/mask and chemical/materials manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the entire fabrication process, from R&D to high volume production. These products and services\nare designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help customers accelerate development and production ramp cycles, achieve higher and more stable product yields and improve\ntheir overall profitability.\nWithin the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, we develop and sell advanced vacuum deposition and etch process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty\nsemiconductor customers, including manufacturers of microelectromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d), radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) communication semiconductors, and power\nsemiconductors for automotive and industrial applications.\nWithin the PCB and Component Inspection segment, we sell products and services that enable electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs, IC substrates\nand packaged ICs to verify their quality, pattern the desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple\nsurfaces.\nAdditional information about KLA is available at www.kla.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and\namendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably\npracticable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the\nSEC. Additionally, these filings may be obtained through the SEC\u2019s website (www.sec.gov), which contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information\nregarding issuers that file electronically.\nInvestors and others should note that we may announce material financial information to investors using our investor relations website (ir.kla.com), which includes our SEC\nfilings, press releases, public earnings calls and conference webcasts. The investor relations website is used to communicate with the public about us and our products, services and\nother matters.\nIndustry\nOur core focus is enabling technological advances and improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a\nbare silicon wafer - a round disk typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is\nhighly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon.

The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other\nfunctions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many performed multiple times. Most chips consist\nof two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors, which performs the \u201csmart\u201d functions; and the upper \u201cinterconnect\u201d structure, typically\nconsisting of circuitry, which connects the components in the lower structure. When the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality.\nThe wafer is then cut into individual chips, and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips. Packaged chips are then\nmounted onto PCBs for connection to the rest of the electronic system.\nOur business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers. This is driven by the current and anticipated\nmarket demand for ICs, products utilizing ICs and other electronic components. We do not consider our business to be seasonal. Still, our business has historically been cyclical with\nrespect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of\nsuch manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate, or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as\ncustomer consolidation, could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.\nCompanies anticipating future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor\nmarket. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are critical goals of modern semiconductor and related electronics\nmanufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase IC manufacturers\u2019 revenue and profit for a given product. Leading\nsemiconductor manufacturers invest in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries,\nnew transistor architectures, new power distribution schemes, advanced multi-patterning optical and extreme ultraviolet (\u201cEUV\u201d) lithography, and advanced packaging techniques.\nAs design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects. Device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) also\nbecome more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials require extensive characterization before they can be used in the\nmanufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face. The continuing evolution of\nsemiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to\nmanufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced IC fabrication facility today can cost well above $10 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In\naddition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their\nexisting equipment.\nThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has been experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading-edge foundry and logic\nmanufacturers to support computational power and connectivity for markets such as artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and 5G wireless technology and increasing investment by our\ncustomers in legacy nodes. The growth of virtual engagement and the pace of digitization has been driven by COVID-19 related travel restrictions, work from home activities, and\nadvances in healthcare and industrial applications. These factors, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-\nedge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. Intertwined in these areas, spurred by the requirements of AI, is the growth in demand for memory chips.\nRegionalization of semiconductors has become a trend as access to semiconductors is viewed from the lens of national security. China remains as a major region for the\nmanufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world\u2019s largest consumer of ICs. The Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability are\npropelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity.

Whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers, reticles, ICs, FPD or PCB products, our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best\nproducts and services to meet technology and business requirements.\nBacklog\nOur backlog, which represents our remaining performance obligation (\u201cRPO\u201d) to deliver products and services, totaled $9.83 billion and $11.40 billion as of June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received. We expect to recognize approximately 59% to 64% of these\nperformance obligations as revenue in the next 12 months, 29% to 34% in the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter, but this estimate is subject to constant change. The\ntiming of revenue recognition of our RPO is evaluated quarterly and is largely driven by multiple variables, many of which are beyond our control, such as: the readiness of customer\nfabs, end market needs for capacity, changes in the estimated versus actual start time of customers\u2019 projects, timing of delivery and installation dates, supply chain constraints and\nchanges in regulations. The estimated amount and timing of revenue recognition are also dependent on the following:\nMacro-economic factors and the effect on customer behavior\n: Our customers are currently purchasing equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our\nhistorical experience. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological, production or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is\nincreased risk of order modifications, pushouts or cancellations.\nExport restrictions:\n Commerce and BIS have mandated the following BIS Rules in October 2022 and October 2023:\n\u2022\nRequiring an export license from BIS for sale of anything to an entity on the U.S. Entity List of China-based entities, which is a list of parties that are generally ineligible to\nreceive U.S.-regulated products and services without prior licensing, as well as for the use of certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to\nmanufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List.\n\u2022\nRequiring an export license for sales to China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses, and for certain U.S. semiconductor and high-\nperformance computing technology (including wafer fab equipment), for the use of such technology for certain end uses in China, and for the provision of support by U.S.\npersons to certain advanced IC fabs located in China.\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4416, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bd11f69-86fe-48a3-b46c-a53a3a5ede15": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bd11f69-86fe-48a3-b46c-a53a3a5ede15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "55922054cd367f4319a34fbb8cf6a0afef2bbeab8538e6a27a3546f47fa2e6f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nWe are taking appropriate measures to comply with these regulations and are applying for export licenses, when required, although there can be no assurance that export\nlicenses will be granted. The possible negative effects on our future business of export licenses not being granted could be material and could result in a substantial reduction to our\nRPO or require us to return substantial deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders previously placed.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\nWe perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy to manufacture components and major subassemblies. Our in-house\nmanufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies acquired from third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our\nfinished products. Our principal manufacturing activities occur in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and China. Our supply chain strategy incorporates\nconsiderations for ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, and Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and there are increasing regulatory expectations on\nthe environmental, social and/or geographic provenance of materials or components that may at times require us to incorporate further such considerations to our supply chain\nstrategy.\nSome critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, \u201cparts\u201d) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications,\nwhile other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials to manufacture and support our products. Although we make\nreasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible. Certain parts and raw materials included in our\nsystems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production\ninterruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors\nto increase capacity when required, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key\nparts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within\nour suppliers\u2019 often complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nCompetition\nThe worldwide market for technologically advanced process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers\nis highly competitive, with important competitive factors including system performance, ease of use, reliability, technical service and support, and overall cost of ownership.\nHowever, we believe that, while the competitive factors listed are important, the customers\u2019 overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated\ncapabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity, improve yields and reduce waste. To remain competitive, we use significant\nfinancial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product R&D. In each of our product markets, we\nhave many competitors, including companies such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Onto Innovation, Inc. and Lasertec,\nInc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the\ndesign and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved pricing and performance characteristics. We may also face future competition from\nnew market entrants overseas or domestically. We maintain our market position by building long-term relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs, as well as\nanticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies, as discussed further in the \u201cIndustry\u201d section of this Item\n1. Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could\nnegatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share. Should this occur, it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions\nWe continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,\nincluding management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key\nemployees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\n7", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5545, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2f608bc-74c6-4067-8a00-e172b2942cc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2f608bc-74c6-4067-8a00-e172b2942cc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "a90d495b63c99faa98abe44ce45a0df423e4be31e5582fa07b5ad707bdc4669b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5147cecc-1439-412a-8053-dba8be517d05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc3b6ad6671600301f8285f468598b781e9b26929dbb415807ea38de7e1daf76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nPatents and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of IP laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret.

In our drive to be better, we seek to create an increasingly diverse workforce. We\ndo this because KLA, like society, benefits when we work with diverse teams to harness varying perspectives and talents in the furtherance of humanity.\nKLA is an equal opportunity employer and we follow affirmative action requirements applicable to federal contractors. We continue to look for ways to recruit, develop and\nretain a more diverse workforce with a focus on groups underrepresented in the technology field. We continue to provide training with a focus on inclusion. Managers and employees\nare introduced to models of intentional inclusion that emphasize key leadership qualities. We continued our campaign on Inclusion For All through fiscal 2024. This campaign\nengages all employees in KLA\u2019s I&D efforts by providing tips on everyday actions that can have large impacts. This campaign supplements the formal training we offer around I&D\nand the work of our Employee Resource Groups (\u201cERG\u201d).\nKLA currently has four ERGs with chapters around the world to engage employees in service of our I&D and business goals, fostering an inclusive environment. WISE\n(Women in STEM, Empowered), is an employee-led group that includes people of all genders, who have joined to support the professional growth of women at KLA. WISE has\nchapters in the U.S., Israel, Europe and India with more chapters forming in other regions. Konexi\u00f3n is our Hispanic/Latinx ERG where employees can interact and innovate through\ncultural sharing and understanding of the Hispanic/Latinx community. BELIEVE (Black Employees Leading in Inclusion, Excellence, Values and Education) supports the\nrecruitment and advancement of Black talent while also promoting cultural awareness, understanding and allyship of the Black community. Both Konexi\u00f3n and BELIEVE have\nchapters throughout the U.S. Our fourth ERG is PRISM (where Pride, Respect, Inclusion and Solidarity Meet), and was started as a global ERG.

Through our partnerships with Stanford University\nand the University of Michigan, employees can pursue advanced degrees in engineering that are customized for KLA, and the skills and competencies required to support our\ncustomers. We also offer a competitive student loan reimbursement program in the U.S.\nWe have a robust succession planning process especially targeted at director level positions and above. Additionally, our Values in Action training, which was also targeted at\nthe director level and above, provided further guidance on our values, business ethics and inclusion and diversity.\nMost of our employees are also required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data\nprivacy and workplace health and safety.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on several topics. The feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess\nemployee sentiment, identify areas of improvement and guides our decision-making as it relates to people management. In addition, our executives conduct regular quarterly\nwebcasts that enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open Q&A session.\nAs we emerged from the global pandemic, many employees continued to seek connections. Through our Employee Engagement Survey, we continued to identify the top\npriorities in a post-pandemic world. We created action plans and involved our workforce in developing potential solutions to address these top concerns. We created initiatives\nincluding global manager communications, individual and team coaching and a training course titled \u201cEngaging with Engagement.\u201d\nEmployee Health and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this\nthrough strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates,\nutilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans.\nA legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the development and implementation of a global approach to Employee Health and Safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) with strong collaboration\nacross the regions. This has resulted in the adoption of best practices for each of our sites, improving business resiliency and the health and safety of our employees worldwide. We\ncontinue to monitor developments in our communities to help us be able to adjust practices and controls as needed.\nOur goal is always zero accidents across our facilities, and to achieve that, we conduct proactive risk assessments and audits to constantly improve our efforts. We\nimplemented a global standard for our incidents to ensure consistency across our regions, and continually outperform industry averages for injury rates.\nWe made a commitment to globalize our ISO 45001 (the internationally recognized standard for Occupational Health & Safety (\u201cOHS\u201d) Management Systems) certification\nand expand our ISO 14001 (the internationally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems (\u201cEMS\u201d)) certification beyond our larger sites. In 2023, we continued\nto make progress expanding our ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 programs across our main production and R&D facilities. As of year-end 2023, our sites in Singapore; Newport, Wales;\nMilpitas, California; and Migdal Ha\u2019emek, Israel are certified to ISO 14001 and our Wales site is also certified to ISO 45001.\nWe are committed to reducing safety risks across business units and at corporate sites worldwide. We revised our approach to risk assessments to \u201crisk rank\u201d our own\noperations.

Economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced\nconsumer and business spending, and can cause our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders. The tightening of credit markets, rising interest rates\nand concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment,\nincluding the products we sell. Reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has, at times in the past,\nadversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and, therefore, has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may\nagain be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels.\nIn addition, a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments. Our investment portfolio\nincludes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. Although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of\nsound investments due to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings of such investments, a decline in the capital and financial markets or rising interest rates would adversely\nimpact the market value of our investments and their liquidity.

These rules and regulations may significantly harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in\nfuture periods, unless we are able to obtain required licenses.\nWe maintain significant operations outside the United States, and existing and evolving trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other governments could significantly\ndisrupt our global operations. The U.S. government has tightened export controls for commodities, software, and technology (collectively, \u201citems\u201d) destined to China over the past\nseveral years. These controls have included, for example, restrictions on exporting certain items to military end users and for military end uses, the addition of numerous entities to\nthe U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S.-regulated items without prior licensing from BIS), and the creation of new licensing requirements that\napply to the export, re-export, and transfer of certain foreign-made items that are the direct product of U.S. origin technology or produced by a plant or major component of a plant\nthat itself is the direct product of U.S. origin technology and which are destined to Huawei or its affiliates and other specified companies on the U.S. Entity List.\nIn October 2022, BIS published the 2022 BIS Rules (the \u201c2022 BIS Rules\u201d) that introduce restrictions related to semiconductor, semiconductor manufacturing, supercomputer,\nand advanced computing items and end uses. These rules impose restrictions on our ability to sell, ship and support certain equipment and otherwise conduct business with certain\ncounterparties, primarily including China-based companies involved in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Further, the 2022 BIS Rules impose restrictions on the activities of\nU.S. persons with respect to certain items that are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), which departs from BIS\u2019 typical practice of controlling items that\nare subject to the EAR, and could further restrict our ability to conduct business in China.

To the extent BIS does issue licenses to us or to our customers, such licenses may have a short duration or require us to satisfy various conditions. If pending and\nfuture export license applications are not granted, or additional restrictions are imposed, or if regulators adopt new interpretations of existing regulations, the potential impact on us\ncould be material by disrupting our supply chain and product shipment, impairing our ability to complete product development in a timely manner, or our ability to support existing\ncustomers of covered products or supply customers of covered products outside the impacted regions, and requiring us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the\nidentified countries. Failure to obtain export licenses could also harm our RPO, requiring us to return substantial deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders,\nand/or further limiting our ability to meet our contractual obligations and sell our products or provide services to our customers in China.\nWe may lose revenue in future periods related to anticipated sales to customers in China unless we are able to replace their orders with other customer orders for which either a\nlicense has been obtained or is not required.

Our\nfailure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in government investigations and/or enforcement\nactions, which could result in significant financial cost (including investigation expenses, defense costs, assessments and criminal or civil penalties), reputational harm and other\nconsequences that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business. For instance, in response to the war between Russia and\nUkraine, the U.S., European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions against Russia, Belarus and certain other regions, entities and individuals, and may impose additional\nsanctions, export controls or other measures. The imposition of sanctions, export controls and other measures could adversely impact our business including preventing us from\nperforming existing contracts, recognizing revenue, pursuing new business opportunities or receiving payment for products already supplied or services already performed with\ncustomers.\nAdditionally, we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, including those that control and restrict the use, transportation,\nemission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances. Current and proposed restrictions on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d) may\nnegatively impact our supply chain due to potentially decreased availability, or non-availability, of PFAS-containing products or commercially feasible alternatives. Any failure to\ncomply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities,\nlimitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Some of these laws impose\nstrict liability for certain releases, which may require us to incur costs regardless of fault or the legality of actions at the time of release. In addition, changes in environmental laws\nand regulations (including any relating to climate change and greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions) could require us, or others in our value chain, to install additional equipment, alter\noperations to incorporate new technologies or processes, or revise process inputs, among other things, which may cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely impact\nour business performance. Various agencies and governmental bodies have expressed particular interest in promulgating rules relating to climate change.

Identification, assessment and disclosure of such matters is complex. Many of the\nstatements in such voluntary disclosures are based on our expectations and assumptions, which may require substantial discretion and forecasts about costs and future circumstances.\nAdditionally, expectations regarding companies\u2019 management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control.\nAlthough we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in certain voluntary ESG initiatives, to improve the ESG profile of our operations and product offerings, we\ncannot guarantee that such efforts will have the intended results, including whether we are able to measure and disclose related data of sufficient quality or timeliness or in\naccordance with particular methodological practices. For example, we have adopted certain GHG emissions reduction targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Although several of\nthese goals have been validated by SBTi, our estimates concerning the timing and cost of implementing our goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside of\nour control. In addition, standards for calculating and disclosing emissions and other sustainability metrics continue to evolve, which can result in inconsistencies or other changes to\ndata over time, revisions to our strategies and targets, or our ability to achieve them, subjecting us to additional scrutiny. For example, we have recently elected to align our emissions\nreporting with the SBTi methodology, which will result in certain changes to our emissions metrics from historical calculations; however, to the extent the SBTi methodology is\nultimately deemed to be not in keeping with regulatory standards or best practices, we may be subject to additional scrutiny or costs. Standards for ESG metrics and reporting\ncontinue to evolve due to a variety of factors, and our disclosures may evolve as well; however, we cannot guarantee that our approach will align with any particular methodology or\nstakeholder expectations. Any failure, or perceived failure, to disclose in keeping with best practices, regulations, or other stakeholder expectations or to successfully achieve our\nvoluntary goals, or the manner in which we achieve some or any portion of our goals, could adversely impact our reputation or, to the extent related to our sustainability-linked\ncapital sources, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ESG efforts have included, and may in the future include further adoption, or expansion, of certain ESG practices or policies, which may require us to expend additional\nresources to implement or to forego certain business opportunities to the extent others in our value chain do not meet pertinent requirements of such policies. By contrast, any failure,\nor perceived failure, to conform to such policies could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business activities. Our performance may be subject to greater scrutiny as a\nresult of our announcement of any goals or policies and the publication of our performance against the same. Moreover, despite the voluntary nature of such efforts, we may receive\nincreasing scrutiny and pressure from external sources, such as lenders, investors, proxy advisory firms, rating agencies or other investor advocacy groups, to adopt more transparent\nor aggressive climate or other ESG-related initiatives; however, we may not agree that such initiatives will be appropriate for our business, and we may not be able to implement\nsuch initiatives because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles. Any unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to or increase any negative investor sentiment toward us, our\ncustomers or our industry, which could negatively impact our share price as well as our access to and cost of capital.

Even where insured, there is a risk that an insurer may deny or limit coverage or may become financially incapable of covering claims.\nIn addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities. Our California operations are now primarily centralized in our Milpitas\nfacility. The consolidation of our California operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of\nwar or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our Milpitas facility.\nWe are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If international political instability or geopolitical tensions continue\nor increase, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets. Any act of terrorism or war that\naffects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business. Increased international political instability or geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world,\ndisruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations.\nWe maintain significant operations in Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab\nneighbors, and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for Israel. In October 2023, war between Israel and Hamas began,\nwhich has resulted in significant military activity in the region. In addition, some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces,\nand may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances, including the war against Hamas. Following the war between Israel and Hamas, the Houthis launched a\nnumber of attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red Sea, which marine vessels were thought to either be in route towards Israel or to be partly owned by Israeli businessmen. The\nRed Sea is a vital maritime route for international trade and major shipping companies announced suspensions of operations following these attacks. Disruptions in shipping routes in\nthe Red Sea could result in delays in shipping our products to customers, which could delay the timing of revenue recognition. We cannot assess the impact that emergency\nconditions in Israel may have on our business, operations, financial condition or results of operations, but it could be material. Instability in any region could directly impact our\nability to operate our business (or our customers\u2019 ability to operate their businesses), cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase\nour insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. Instability in any region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver\ntheir products. Our insurance does not cover losses we suffer attributable to war. If international political instability and geopolitical tensions continue or increase in any region in\nwhich we do business, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe self-insure certain risks including earthquake risk. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.\nWe purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot\nbe mitigated with insurance. Accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds\nthe applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy. For example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance. An earthquake could\nsignificantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in California, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes. It could also significantly\ndelay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an\nearthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial\ndecision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a\nsimilar cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance.

Although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.\nWe have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the new Israeli shekel. We have\ninternational subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally. In addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the U.S., and\nmany of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies. We routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial\ninstitutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our\nreported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or\nis otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments, and an impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. In\naddition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock.\nOur investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As market\ninterest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. An impairment of the fair market value of our investments,\neven if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that\nperiod.\nIn addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years. The trading price of our common stock could continue to be\nhighly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including, without limitation, conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate,\nfluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks\ndescribed elsewhere in this Item 1A. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their\ninvestment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other\ncompanies.\nWe are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits (such as related to customs or product safety requirements) in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess\nadditional income or other taxes, penalties, fines or other prohibitions against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply\nwith applicable regulations, the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals\nrelated to income taxes and other contingencies. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or\nperiods for which that determination is made.\nA change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nWe earn profits in, and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in, the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore and Israel, the countries in which we earn\nthe majority of our non-U.S. profits.

The recent U.S. tax law changes are subject to future guidance from U.S. federal and state governments, such as the Treasury\nDepartment and/or the Internal Revenue Service. Any future guidance can change our tax liability. A significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the Tax Act is\npayable by us over a period of eight years. As a result, our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the tax liability is paid in full.\nThe Tax Act also provides that a percentage of foreign earnings under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) regime is taxable in the U.S. and a percentage of\nU.S. earnings under the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (\u201cFDII\u201d) regime is not subject to tax in the U.S. For tax years beginning on January 1, 2026, the percentage of GILTI that\nis taxable in the U.S. increases from 50% to 62.5% and the percentage of FDII not subject to tax in the U.S. decreases from 37.5% to 21.875%. The change in GILTI and FDII\npercentages can have a material and adverse impact to our effective tax rate beginning in the quarter ending September 30, 2026.\nOn August 16, 2022, the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cIRA\u201d) introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) that is effective for us beginning in the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. The CAMT applies a 15% minimum income tax rate on certain large corporations. We are not expecting to have any effective tax rate impact\nfrom the CAMT but changes to U.S. tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws may result in CAMT liability which can have a material and adverse impact to our future effective\ntax rates.\nNumerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part, to recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s\n(\u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. The OECD continues to advance its work under the BEPS 2.0 initiative to develop the framework for Pillar Two -\nwhich aims to implement a global minimum tax of 15%. Many countries have enacted or drafted legislation using the Pillar Two framework to propose domestic tax laws requiring a\nminimum tax rate of 15% (\u201ctop-up tax\u201d) on income earned in the respective countries. One country that has drafted Pillar Two legislation is Singapore, where KLA earns significant\nprofits and currently benefits from tax incentives granted by the Singapore Economic Development Board. If enacted, the tax liability from top-up tax may have a material and\nadverse impact to our effective tax rate in the fiscal year when such law is effective.\nCompliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements, has become increasingly complex, and the significant attention and\nexpense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.\nFederal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose\ncomprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal\npenalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.

The trends our management monitors in operating our business include the following:\n\u2022\nThe potential for reversal of the long-term historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor\nindustry, and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business;\n\u2022\nThe increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers\u2019 capital equipment investment decisions;\n\u2022\nDiffering market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications, such as memory and foundry/logic;\n\u2022\nLower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundry/logic customers;\n\u2022\nOur customers\u2019 reuse of existing and installed products, which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes;\n\u2022\nThe emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes (or the economics associated with semiconductor\nmanufacturing) and, as a result, also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes;\n\u2022\nThe higher design costs for the most advanced ICs, which could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the\nlarge, technologically advanced products and applications;\n\u2022\nThe possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor\nmanufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nChanges in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and, accordingly, our customers could reduce their available\nbudgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies;\n\u2022\nThe bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into (a) leading edge manufacturers driving continued R&D into next-generation products and technologies and\n(b) other manufacturers that are content with existing (including previous generation) products and technologies;\n\u2022\nThe ever escalating cost of next-generation product development, which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to\nhelp fund such programs that could restrict our control and ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs; and\n\u2022\nThe entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased\noutsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market\npressures.\nAny of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers\u2019 rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce, which could result in downward\npressure on our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.

Many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may\nseek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, IP-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business and we may not be able to pass on the\ncost of inflation to our customers. Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins;\n\u2022\nCertain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced\nmanufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions. Any future change in ownership or\nmanagement of our existing customers may result in similar challenges, including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor\u2019s\nproducts;\n\u2022\nThe highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers. For example, as a result of the\nchallenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and, in some cases, continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial\nviability of certain of our customers. To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional credit losses with respect to\nreceivables owed to us by those customers. In addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment, delay deliveries of our products,\ndiscontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and, in either case, such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base;\n\u2022\nSemiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a\nsemiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s process control and yield management equipment, the\nmanufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult\nto sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a\ncompetitor\u2019s equipment; and\n\u2022\nPrices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. If there is a shift in demand by our customers\nfrom our higher-priced to lower-priced products, our gross margin and revenues would decrease. In addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher\ncosts because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate in industries that have historically been cyclical, including the semiconductor industry. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on\nthe economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business, financial\ncondition and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nThe timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict. The historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor\nindustry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers\u2019 capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which, in turn, are affected by\nfactors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products, inventory levels and our customers\u2019 access to capital. Cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future\nrevenue and, in some cases, future expense levels. During down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only\nin a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their\nfinancial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers. Our ability to recognize revenue from a particular\ncustomer may also be negatively impacted by the customer\u2019s funding status, which could be weakened not only by rising interest rates, adverse business conditions or inaccessibility\nto capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or company-specific reasons, but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer\u2019s unique organizational structure.

If we fail to respond, or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results, our business could be seriously\nharmed. Furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our\noperations and loss of key personnel.

We\ncan provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. Each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nThe growth that we have experienced over the past few years has resulted in higher levels of backlog, or RPO. The supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing pandemic\nas well as favorable market trends have led to customers agreeing to purchase equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our historical experience. As the lead times for\ndelivery of our equipment get longer, the risk increases that customers may choose to change their equipment orders due to the evolution of the customer\u2019s technological, production\nor market needs. This could result in order modifications, rescheduling or even cancellations that may not be communicated to us in a timely manner, causing RPO to remain\nelevated until agreed with the customer.

These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools significantly\nbelow our product offerings. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer,\nusing innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading\ntechnology, which is the result of continuing significant investments in product R&D. However, we may enter new markets, whether through acquisitions or new internal product\ndevelopment, in which competition is based primarily on product pricing, not technological superiority. Further, some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading\ntechnologies. Loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve, or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter, could\nnegatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner.\nWe use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these\nmaterials. Generally, we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers\u2019 orders, we do not maintain an\nextensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. Through our business interruption planning, we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages\nof key parts by, among other things, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers and maintaining\nappropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, certain key parts are available only from a single\nsupplier or a limited group of suppliers. Also, key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers\u2019 proprietary IP; in those cases, we are increasingly reliant on\nthird parties for high-performance, high-technology components, which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and IP that is\nused in our products. In addition, if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations, which is a heightened risk, especially during\neconomic downturns, it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products. Similarly, especially with respect to suppliers of high-technology\ncomponents, our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains, and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in\na timely manner and result in delays for our products, or our suppliers might pass on the cost of inflation to us while we are unable to adjust pricing with our own customers. Our\noperating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications, or if we are able to do so\nonly on unfavorable terms. Furthermore, a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons, including the supplier\u2019s financial condition or business\noperational decisions, which would require us to purchase, in a single transaction, a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts\nremains available to our customers. Such \u201cend-of-life\u201d parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period, and, ultimately, any unused parts may\nresult in a significant inventory write-off, either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods.\nIf we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan, our operating results, business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted.\nWe attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even\nmore frequently (at least monthly).

Our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims, regardless\nof their merit or outcomes.\nWe are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our products and production processes are extremely complex and, thus, could\ncontain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us,\nincluding increased service or warranty costs, providing product replacements for (or modifications to) defective products, litigation related to defective products, reimbursement for\ndamages caused by our products, product recalls, or product write-offs or disposal costs. These costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results. In addition, our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects, which could reduce demand for our\nproducts and negatively impact our business.\nFurthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives,\nsuch as credits toward future purchases. We believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase\nlarger volumes of our products. However, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the\npotential future credits or other volume purchase incentives. Our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the\nestimate of volume of future purchases. As such, we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis. Until the earnings process is complete, our estimates\ncould differ in comparison to actual results. As a result, these volume purchase arrangements, while expected to be beneficial to our business over time, could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations in near-term periods, including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and, therefore, our gross margins.\nIn addition, we may, in limited circumstances, enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels,\nresponse time and other commitments, and we may be unable to adjust pricing with our customers despite rising inflation in our supply chain. Furthermore, we may give these\ncustomers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights,\nwe may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of\nsuch audit or inspection. To date, we have made no significant accruals in our Consolidated Financial Statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred\nsignificant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.

In addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the\ncosts that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs. Any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government\nfunding program.

We may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or demand for service inventory decline. Also, in the event that our lead times from\nsuppliers increase (possibly due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide) and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease (which may be due\nto many factors, including the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production), we may be compelled to increase\nour commitments, and, therefore, our risk exposure, to inventory purchases to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner, and that inventory may need to be written off if\ndemand for the underlying product declines for any reason.

Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of\nnet assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for\ngoodwill. Purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straight-\nline method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets. The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions\nand estimates of many critical factors, including, but not limited to, declines in our operating cash flows, declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our market\nshare, and declines in revenues or profits. A substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of\nchanging one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous\nimpairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.\nAny such additional material charges, whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment, may have a material negative impact on our\noperating results and related financial statements.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our receivables factoring and banking arrangements.\nWe enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.

Our broad portfolio of\ninspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and\nexpertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges\nand to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, FPDs, specialty\nsemiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, LED, power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as\ngeneral materials research.\nOur semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. The pervasive and\nincreasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products, the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices, and the\nincreasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drive demand for our process control and yield management solutions. Continuing advancement of\ninnovation spurred by the performance, power and price benefits of being at the leading edge, increasing involvement in legacy nodes as semiconductor content increases, and\ninnovation and growth of new enabling technologies are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry. End-market demand drivers that are expected to\ncontinue in the long term are related to high performance computing, AI including 2-nanometer chip technology, the deployment of 5G telecommunications technology and\nassociated high-end mobile devices, the electrification and digitization of the automotive industry, the revival of personal computer demand and associated innovations to support\nremote work, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment, and the growth of the IoT.\nRecently, the semiconductor industry environment has improved as the emergence of disruptive technologies such as AI and continuing advancement of innovation, as well as\nrising semiconductor content across end-markets and strategic investments in legacy nodes fuel growth. Our foundry/logic customers are slowly increasing their capital intensity, as\nthey continue to scale and incorporate new technologies. Additionally, technology development investments supporting AI and high bandwidth memory are improving the\nenvironment for memory device manufacturers. While we continue to invest in technological innovation, factors such as delays from customers, in adopting new chips and\ntechnology methods, could impact process control capital intensity. Push out or cancellation of deliveries to our customers could still cause earnings volatility, due to the timing of\nrevenue recognition as well as increased risk of inventory-related charges.\nWe are organized into three reportable segments, as follows:\n\u2022\nSemiconductor Process Control: a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC\nmanufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.\n\u2022\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.\n\u2022\nPCB and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, advanced\npackaging, MEMS and other electronic components. In March 2024, we made the decision to exit the Display business by announcing the end of manufacturing of most\nDisplay products by December 31, 2024, but we will continue to provide services to the installed base of Display products for existing customers.\nA majority of our revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and include geographic regions such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia.

Management uses\njudgments in identifying performance obligations, determining the stand-alone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for each distinct performance obligation and allocating consideration from an\narrangement to the individual performance obligations based on the SSP. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products\nand services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have established SSP ranges for individual products and services due to the\nstratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region as well as customization of\nthe products in determining the SSP ranges. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-\nspecific factors including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the\nallocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of\nrevenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, management also uses judgments to evaluate whether or not\nthe customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer, which could also impact the\ntiming of revenue recognition, and could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nInventory Valuation.\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The\ncarrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future\ndemand for meeting our product manufacturing plans and our customers\u2019 support requirements. The estimate of net realizable value of inventory is impacted by assumptions\nregarding general semiconductor market conditions, manufacturing schedules, technology changes, new product introductions and possible alternative uses, and requires us to use\nsignificant judgment that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded\ninventory values. If in any period we anticipate an adverse change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates,\nadditional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. On the other hand, if\nin any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down in a previous period to a level below the ultimate realized selling price, related revenue would be recorded\nwith a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of revenues resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment.\n We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment\ncharge for goodwill include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits at our\nreporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference.\nWe determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach or market approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the\nresults are judgmentally weighted. The income approach is estimated through discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is computed by adding the\npresent value of the estimated annual discounted cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period.

Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment charge for long-lived assets\nprimarily include declines in our operating cash flows from the use of these assets.\nFor finite-lived purchased intangible assets, we determine whether the assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be\ngenerated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the assets\u2019 carrying value, we recognize an\nimpairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nWe determine the fair value of purchased intangible assets using the income approach, primarily by applying the relief-from-royalty or multi-period excess-earnings methods.\nIn connection with the downward revision of financial outlook for our PCB and Display businesses noted above, we recorded impairment losses related to purchased intangible\nassets of $26.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of the Company's decision to exit the Display business, also described above, an immaterial purchased\nintangible asset impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThere can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our fair value calculations will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions are not\nrealized, or if there are future changes in any of the assumptions due to a change in economic conditions or otherwise, it is possible that a further impairment charge may need to be\nrecorded in the future.\nSee Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome Taxes. \nThe calculation of our effective tax rate involves significant judgment in the application of complex tax laws among various tax jurisdictions worldwide;\nidentifying uncertain tax positions; and estimating the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized in the future. We believe that our tax positions and judgments are\nreasonable, but actual results may differ. If one or more taxing authorities were to successfully overturn our tax positions, it could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax\nrate, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are recorded for uncertain tax positions on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recorded\nunrecognized tax benefits of $245.7 million and $213.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a\nquarterly basis based on certain factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances; changes in tax law; audit settlements; new audit activities; and changes in\naccounting standards. Any changes to these factors can result in a material change to tax expense.\nOur calculations of deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on estimates and judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and projections of\nfuture taxable income. The guidance requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax\nasset will not be realized in the foreseeable future. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our\nfuture taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. We recorded a valuation allowance of $289.5 million and $259.2 million for the years\nended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to California credit carry-forwards. Based on the enacted income apportionment rules in California, our future\nCalifornia income tax liability will not be sufficient to fully utilize the credit carry-forwards.

Revenue is also impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements, the\neffect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and increased trade restrictions as discussed in the \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d section above.\nThe decrease in product revenues by 11% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to the broad, macro-driven slowdown that\nhas impacted semiconductor demand overall, causing the semiconductor industry to rebalance its supply chain and reduce inventory levels, and memory device manufacturers and\nfoundry/logic customers to reduce their capacity expansion-focused capital expenditure plans.\nService revenues\nService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our\nservice revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers\u2019 sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as\nour rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe increase in service revenues by 10% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base.\nRevenues by segment\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n \n \n \n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFY24 vs. FY23\nFY23 vs. FY22\nRevenues:\nSemiconductor Process Control\n$\n8,733,556 \n$\n9,324,190 \n$\n7,924,822 \n$\n(590,634)\n(6)\n%\n$\n1,399,368 \n18 \n%\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process\n528,701 \n543,398 \n456,579 \n(14,697)\n(3)\n%\n86,819 \n19 \n%\nPCB and Component Inspection\n552,491 \n631,604 \n832,176 \n(79,113)\n(13)\n%\n(200,572)\n(24)\n%\nTotal segment revenues\n$\n9,814,748 \n$\n10,499,192 \n$\n9,213,577 \n$\n(684,444)\n(7)\n%\n$\n1,285,615 \n14 \n%\n__________\n(1)\nSegment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Restructuring charges were $44.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to workforce reductions announced and substantially completed in the\nthird and fourth fiscal quarters.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 20 \u201cRestructuring Charges\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n46", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3937, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19db0813-8af5-45bc-bf3b-6dcdd39f0bf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "19db0813-8af5-45bc-bf3b-6dcdd39f0bf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_50", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "3a9498c8b08c7335967dce6713cefdb3ff5545538929b59b71a84812b32cc280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nInterest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net\nYear Ended June 30,\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFY24 vs. FY23\nFY23 vs. FY22\nInterest expense\n$\n311,253 \n$\n296,940 \n$\n160,339 \n$\n14,313 \n5 \n%\n$\n136,601 \n85 \n%\nOther expense (income), net\n$\n(155,075)\n$\n(104,720)\n$\n4,605 \n(50,355)\n(48)\n%\n$\n(109,325)\n(2,374)\n%\nInterest expense as a percentage of total\nrevenues\n3 \n%\n3 \n%\n2 \n%\nOther expense (income), net as a percentage\nof total revenues\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\n\u2014 \n%\nThe increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to additional interest expense on\nour $750.0 million Senior Notes issued in February 2024.\nOther expense (income), net is comprised primarily of fair value adjustments and realized gains or losses on sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, gains or losses\nfrom revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals\nrelated to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nThe change in Other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the following:\nhigher interest income of $87.8 million due to higher rates, partially offset by the following: a pre-tax gain of $29.7 million from the sale of our interest in Orbograph to a portfolio\ncompany of a private equity firm in fiscal year 2023 and a higher net fair value loss of $17.3 million from an equity security compared to the prior fiscal year.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2022, we had no loss on extinguishment of debt.

We\ncurrently intend to indefinitely reinvest $122.1 million of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are\npermanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-\n22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We\nhave accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $1.01 billion of the $1.13 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices.

The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 as\ncompared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 to $1.45 per share that was announced during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested RSUs with dividend equivalent\nrights were $11.8 million and $12.2 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

This\nincrease in cash used was mainly due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale, equity and trading securities of $1.01 billion and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of a\nbusiness of $75.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $64.2 million and a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions of $23.5 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities:\nNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $1.78 billion compared to $2.83 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. This\ndecrease was mainly due to a net increase in debt-related proceeds of $1.53 billion, partially offset by an increase in cash used for common stock repurchases of $423.9 million, and\nan increase in cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $40.5 million.\nSenior Notes:\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured notes totaling $6.70 billion with due dates ranging from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2063. For\nadditional information on these senior notes, see Note 8 \u201cDebt\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our\ncovenants under the relevant indentures associated with the Senior Notes.\nRevolving Credit Facility:\nWe have in place a Credit Agreement for an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity of June 8, 2027 that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion. Subject to the\nterms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2024 (the leverage ratio was 1.51\nto 1.00 and our then maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.50 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving\nCredit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.

As of June 30,\n2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $4.50 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our\nliquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as\nuncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on\nthe timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our\nRevolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and\nother contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months.\nOur credit ratings as of June 30, 2024 are summarized below: \nRating Agency\nRating\nFitch\nA\nMoody\u2019s\nA2\nS&P\nA-\nIn December 2023, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from A- to A.

To mitigate these risks, we\nutilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial\nposition as of June 30, 2024. Actual results may differ materially.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.71 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest\nrate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2024, the\nfair value of the portfolio would have declined by $16.1 million.\nThe fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate Senior Notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as\nmarket interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2024, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes due in various fiscal years ranging from\n2025 to 2063 were $6.26 billion and $6.63 billion, respectively.\nWe have in place a Revolving Credit Facility that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion, has a maturity date of June 8, 2027 with two one-year extension options, and may be\nincreased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear\ninterest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate, which is equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero, plus a\nspread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps, as determined by our credit ratings at the time. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate\nand credit risk due to the timing of the rate resets and changes in the market\u2019s assessment of risk of default, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are also\nobligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate that ranges from 4.5 bps to 12.5 bps, depending upon our then\nprevailing credit rating. As of June 30, 2024 the annual commitment fee was 6 bps. Additionally, as of June 30, 2024, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment\ngrade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be\napproximately $1 million.\nOur equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security, which began publicly trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 5, 2021, was $25.6 million.\nAssuming a decline of 50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately $13 million, based on the\nvalue as of June 30, 2024.\nSee Note 5 \u201cMarketable Securities\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II Item 7; and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market\nevents that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had net forward and option contracts to purchase $254.1 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17\n\u201cDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details).

Financial Statements\nNOTE 1\u2014 \nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business and Principles of Consolidation.\n KLA Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (\u201cKLA\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d and also referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d\n\u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or similar references) is a supplier of process equipment, process control equipment, and data analytics products for a broad range of industries, including semiconductors\nand printed circuit boards (\u201cPCB\u201d). We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles, integrated circuits (\u201cIC\u201d),\nadvanced packaging, light-emitting diodes, power devices, compound semiconductor devices, microelectromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d), data storage and PCBs as well as general\nmaterials research. We also provide comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our extensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products, and\nrelated services, helps IC manufacturers achieve target yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) to final volume\nproduction. We develop and sell advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers. We enable electronic\ndevice manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs and ICs to verify their quality, deposit a pattern of desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-\ndimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces. Our advanced products, coupled with our unique yield management software and services, allow us to deliver the\nsolutions our semiconductor and PCB customers need to achieve their productivity goals by significantly reducing their risks and costs and improving their overall profitability and\nreturn on investment. Headquartered in Milpitas, California, we have subsidiaries both in the U.S. and key markets throughout the world.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KLA and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nComparability. \nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior year\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the current year presentation. The\nreclassifications did not have material effects on the prior year\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows.\nManagement Estimates.\n The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and related disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities) at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nCash Equivalents and Fixed Income Marketable Securities\n. All highly liquid debt instruments with original or remaining maturities of less than three months at the date of\npurchase are cash equivalents. Fixed income marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale for use in current operations, if required, and are reported at fair\nvalue, with unrealized gains and non-credit related unrealized losses, net of tax, presented as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity under the caption \u201cAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\u201d All realized gains and losses are recorded in earnings in the period of occurrence. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized\ngains and losses on investments.\nWe regularly review the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position and evaluate the current expected credit loss by considering available information\nrelevant to the collectability of the security, such as historical experience, market data, issuer-specific factors including credit ratings, default and loss rates of the underlying\ncollateral and structure and credit enhancements, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

Equity securities\nin publicly held companies, or marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Equity securities in privately held companies, or non-\nmarketable equity securities, are accounted for at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities of the same\nissuer. Non-marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review; however, since there are no open-market valuations, the impairment analysis requires\nsignificant judgment. This analysis includes assessment of the investee\u2019s financial condition, the business outlook for its products and technology, its projected results and cash flow,\nfinancing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment, the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity\npreferences held by us or the others. Non-marketable equity securities are included in \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on the balance sheet. Realized and unrealized gains and losses\nresulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are recorded in Other expense (income), net.\nVariable Interest Entities.\n We use a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest entities. The approach focuses on identifying which\nenterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity\u2019s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity. In the event we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of\noperations of the variable interest entity will be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have concluded that none of our equity investments require consolidation\nbased on our most recent qualitative assessment.\nInventory Valuation.\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The\ncarrying value of product inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about\nfuture demand for meeting our product manufacturing plans. The carrying value of service inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost\nand the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand to meet our customers\u2019 support requirements. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing\ncost and written down to their net realizable value. The Company\u2019s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process,\nfinished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. The estimate of net realizable value of inventory is impacted by assumptions regarding general semiconductor market\nconditions, manufacturing schedules, technology changes, new product introductions and possible alternative uses, and require us to use significant judgment that may include\nuncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Our manufacturing overhead\nstandards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as\ncosts of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges.\nAllowance for Credit Losses.\n A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout\nthe world. We maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are\nclassified as selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a\ncollective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. The estimate of\nexpected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. Our assessment considered estimates of expected credit and collectability trends. The credit losses recognized\non accounts receivable were not significant as of June 30, 2024 and 2023\n.\n Volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability\nthat may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods.\nProperty and Equipment.\n Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is based on the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \nThe following table\n60", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5498, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97b1500f-8402-4051-a438-51aad0893f79": {"__data__": {"id_": "97b1500f-8402-4051-a438-51aad0893f79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_64", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "3452852d99250afcebc269e36f1d9af5613898abc917b6f5cec2f9a221cf026f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23d2ae36-15db-4d26-afca-3b3595591d75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab4b11c9a2c6e84ce785842e059f54515f1d3ac05318f76123effb3437446ced", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nsets forth the estimated useful life for various asset categories:\nAsset Category\nRange of Useful Lives\nBuildings\n30\n to \n50\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of \n15\n years or lease term\nMachinery and equipment\n2\n to \n10\n years\nOffice furniture and fixtures\n7\n years\nConstruction-in-process assets are not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.\n Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was\n$\n181.7\n million, $\n154.2\n million and $\n122.2\n million, respectively.\nLeases\n. Under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, Leases, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset for a\nperiod of time. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to, and the agreement creates\nenforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for our use. On the commencement date,\nleases are evaluated for classification and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nThe lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The right of\nuse (\u201cROU\u201d) asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments and any lease incentives. Variable lease payments,\nconsisting primarily of reimbursement of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, are not included in the lease liability and are\nrecognized as they are incurred.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure ROU assets and lease liabilities. The\nincremental borrowing rate used by us is based on baseline rates and adjusted by the credit spreads commensurate with our secured borrowing rate, over a similar term. We used the\nincremental borrowing rate on June 30, 2019 for all leases that commenced on or prior to that date. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nWe have elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for the majority of our asset classes. For leases with a\nterm of one year or less, we have elected not to record the ROU asset or liability.\nGoodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment.\n Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of\nthe net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We assess goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthe carrying value may not be fully recoverable. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. In the qualitative\nassessment, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed, which involves\ncomparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If goodwill is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as\nthe difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Refer to Note 7 \u201cGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\u201d for information related to determining the fair value of a\nreporting unit.\nPurchased intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from \nsix months\n to\nnine years\n. The carrying values of our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset\ngroup may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets.\n Long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be\nrecoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment charge for the long-lived assets primarily\ninclude declines in our operating cash flows from the use of these assets.

We invest in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not\nlimited to, certificates of deposit, corporate debt and municipal securities, U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, and equity securities and, by policy, we limit the amount\nof credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. We have not experienced any material credit losses on our investments.\nA majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers located throughout the world, with a majority\nlocated in Asia. In recent years, our customer base has become increasingly concentrated due to corporate consolidations, acquisitions and business closures, and to the extent that\nthese customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to reserve for potential credit losses with respect to trade receivables. We perform ongoing credit\nevaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition and generally require little to no collateral to secure accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for potential credit losses based\nupon expected collectability risk of all accounts receivable. In addition, we may utilize letters of credit (\u201cLC\u201d) or non-recourse factoring to mitigate credit risk when considered\nappropriate.\nWe are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties on the foreign exchange contracts that we use in hedging activities and in certain factoring\ntransactions. These counterparties are large international financial institutions, and, to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to us under such\ncontracts.\nThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, primarily in the Semiconductor Process Control segment, for the indicated periods:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\nLimited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\nLimited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\nLimited\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated below:\nAs of June 30,\n2024\n2023\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\nForeign Currency.\n The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are primarily the local currencies, except as described below. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of\nthese foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in\neffect during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of\nstockholders\u2019 equity under the caption \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\u201d\nOur manufacturing subsidiaries in Singapore, Israel, Germany, and the United Kingdom use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities in non-functional currency of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenues and costs in local currency are remeasured\nusing average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement\ngains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.\nDerivative Financial Instruments.\n We use financial instruments, such as foreign exchange contracts including forward and options transactions, to hedge a portion of, but not\nall, existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. The purpose of our foreign exchange hedging program is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations\non certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The effect of exchange rate changes on foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect\nof exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items. We also use forward contracts to hedge the risk associated with the variability of cash flows due to changes in the\nbenchmark interest rate of the intended debt financing (\u201cRate Lock Agreements\u201d). We believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise\nresult from changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates. All of our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable\ninstruments adjusted for risk of counterparty non-performance.\n62", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3a9d1fa-28c2-4c01-941f-93ea2bbe7da7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3a9d1fa-28c2-4c01-941f-93ea2bbe7da7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_66", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "d61ff9e2c84615d05ad73bcecc643e9556f04ba1034faaf0a86047088114b0e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nFor derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions or debt financing, the effective portion of\nthe gains or losses is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings. We elected to include time value for the assessment of effectiveness on all forward transactions designated as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value\nof the derivative is recorded in AOCI until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The assessment of effectiveness of options contracts designated as cash flow hedges\nexcludes time value. The initial value of the component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative contract. Any\ndifferences between change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in AOCI. For foreign exchange contracts that are\ndesignated and qualify as a net investment hedge in a foreign operation and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange\nrates are recorded in cumulative translation within AOCI. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings using the mark-to-market approach.\nRecognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net\ninvestment in the hedged foreign operations. For foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses are recognized in Other expense (income), net. We\nuse foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivative instruments are largely offset by the\nchanges in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.\nRevenue Recognition.\n We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and process-enabling solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries,\nmaintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services and the sale of spare parts. Our portfolio includes yield enhancement and production solutions for\nmanufacturing wafers and reticles, ICs, packaging, PCBs and flat panel displays (\u201cFPD\u201d), as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base.\nOur solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.\nWe account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the\ncontract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third\nparties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer.\nOur arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate\nperformance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on\nits own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.\nThe transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price\n(\u201cSSP\u201d) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as historical stand-alone sales of products and services,\ndiscounting strategies and other observable data.\nFrom time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for\nprospectively.\nProduct Revenue\nWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use\njudgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators, including whether:\n\u2022\nWe have a present right to payment;\n\u2022\nThe customer has legal title;\n\u2022\nThe customer has physical possession;\n\u2022\nThe customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and\n\u2022\nThe customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the\ncustomer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same\n63", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5017, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a63f665-8bb3-4245-97d3-c02ae76cb878": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a63f665-8bb3-4245-97d3-c02ae76cb878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "0eb1861ca028ecfcd17f745e1c591b837486585b4aaa70e26265169a6ca1cd73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nspecifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed\nperfunctory).\nNot all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product\nacceptance, the fair value of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install the product is deferred and recognized as revenue at a point in time, once installation is\ncomplete.\nWe enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits and incentives earned by our customers.\nThese credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed incentive rate. The estimate is reviewed for material changes and\nupdated at each reporting period.\nWe offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit\nfrom the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d), which\nincludes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when\nthe software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\nServices Revenue\nThe majority of product sales include a standard \n12\n-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase an extended warranty\nfor periods beyond the initial period as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard \n12\n-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in\nthe initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue\nover the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.\nAdditionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the\ninitial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period.\nRevenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare\nparts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the\ncontext of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an\narrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically\nestimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable\nrange. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we\nuse information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly\nobservable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class\nof customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total\nrevenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nAlthough our products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or\nmaterial right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each\nreporting period if and when additional information becomes available.\nAs outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not\ncontrol has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.\n64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5377, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fa6db58-7a92-4706-9fb0-48e48a252486": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fa6db58-7a92-4706-9fb0-48e48a252486", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "2028f2de5fe397c8c236cbfd5466232138dea4ab7cab6c10cdaf8e0df348e12b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07411c3d-5844-4a07-883a-9bcae982113a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5dc74d01d57c053c9a9fb460e5a573c78bcbfcb7d35473ecfc9fa30552930bbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nContract Assets/Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets\nprimarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are\ntransferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.\nA contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities\nrepresent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the\ncustomers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring\nservices to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.\nContract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nResearch and Development Costs.\n R&D costs are expensed as incurred.\nShipping and Handling Costs.\n Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans.\n We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair\nvalue of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units (\u201cRSU\u201d)\ngranted without \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which\nare not accrued on the RSUs. The fair value for RSUs granted with \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The\naward holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated RSU award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable\nin cash or shares of common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the RSUs had the shares been issued\nand outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award).\nCompensation expense for RSUs with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market\ncondition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation incorporates estimates of the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant\ndate fair value of each award. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the\nestimated amounts. The fair value for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights. The Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option\u2019s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price\nvolatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.\nAccounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation.\n Cash-based long-term incentive (\u201cCash LTI\u201d) awards issued to employees under our Cash Long-Term\nIncentive Plan (\u201cCash LTI Plan\u201d) vest in \nthree\n or \nfour\n equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly\nanniversary of the grant date over a \nthree\n- or \nfour-year\n period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable\naward vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term and adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.\nAccounting for Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan.\n We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (known as the \u201cExecutive Deferred Savings Plan\u201d\n(\u201cEDSP\u201d)) under which certain executives and non-employee directors may defer a portion of their compensation.

Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using\nenacted tax rates for the future tax impact of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities.

The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%\nlikely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income.\n The Tax Cut and Jobs Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) wherein U.S. taxes on foreign\nincome are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income is effectively taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. We elect to account for\nGILTI as a component of current period tax expense and not recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions.\nBusiness Combinations.\n We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired,\nincluding in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d), based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair\nvalues of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

This amount includes customer deposits of $\n745.7\n million as disclosed in Note 4 \u201cFinancial Statement\nComponents\u201d and excludes contract liabilities of $\n1.78\n billion as disclosed above. We expect to recognize approximately \n59\n% to \n64\n% of these performance obligations as revenue in\nthe next \n12\n months, \n29\n% to \n34\n% in the subsequent \n12\n months and the remainder thereafter, but this estimate is subject to constant change. The timing of revenue recognition of our\nRPO is evaluated quarterly and is largely driven by multiple variables, many of which are beyond our control, such as: the readiness of customer fabs, end market needs for capacity,\nchanges in the estimated versus actual start time of customers\u2019 projects, timing of delivery and installation dates, supply chain constraints and changes in regulations. Our customers\nare currently purchasing equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our historical experience. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological,\nproduction or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is elevated risk of order modifications, pushouts or cancellations.\nIn addition, in October 2022, the U.S. government issued regulations that imposed new export licensing requirements for certain U.S. semiconductor and high-performance\ncomputing technology (including wafer fab equipment), for the use of such technology for certain end uses in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d), and for the provision of\nsupport by U.S. Persons to certain advanced IC fabs located in China. The regulations impose export license requirements effectively on all KLA products and services to customers\nlocated in China that fabricate certain advanced logic, NAND and DRAM ICs. KLA is also restricted from providing certain U.S. origin tools, software and technology to certain\nwafer fab equipment manufacturers located in China, absent an export license. In October 2023, the U.S. government issued additional regulations that went into effect in November\n2023. These additional rules are designed to update export controls on advanced computing semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as items that\nsupport supercomputing applications and end-uses, to arms embargoed countries, including China. They adjust the parameters included in the existing regulations that determine\nwhether an advanced computing chip is restricted and impose new measures to address risks of circumvention of the controls established in October 2022. The regulations are very\ncomplex and, in January 2024, KLA, among other companies, submitted comments to the government regarding these regulations. We are taking appropriate measures to comply\nwith all government regulations, and will continue to apply for export licenses, when required, to avoid disruption to our customers\u2019 operations. While some export licenses have\nbeen obtained by us or our customers, there can be no assurance that export licenses applied for by either us or our customers, now or in the future, will be granted.\nPractical expedients\nWe apply the following practical expedients in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:\n\u2022\nWe account for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer goods, instead of a promised service to our customer.\n\u2022\nWe have elected to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period\nbetween when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less.\n\u2022\nWe have elected to expense costs to obtain a contract as incurred because the expected amortization period is one year or less.\nRefer to Note 19 \u201cSegment Reporting and Geographic Information\u201d for information related to revenue by geographic region as well as significant product and service\nofferings.\nNOTE 3 \u2014 \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for our debt and certain equity investments in privately held companies.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest\npriority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1\nValuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\nLevel 2\nValuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3\nValuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There were no transfers\nbetween Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements during the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nThe types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets included money market funds, certain U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency\nsecurities and equity securities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs included corporate debt securities, municipal securities and certain U.S. Treasury securities. The market\ninputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nThe principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price\ntransparency. The market participants generally are large financial institutions. Our foreign currency contracts\u2019 valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing\nintervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment. These contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair values of contingent consideration payable, the majority of which were recorded in connection with business combinations, were classified as Level 3 and estimated\nusing significant inputs that were not observable in the market.\n See Note 6 \u201cBusiness Combinations and Dispositions\u201d for additional information.\n69", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

The income\napproach is estimated through discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of this reporting unit was computed by adding the present value of the estimated annual\ndiscounted cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This valuation technique requires us to use significant\nestimates and assumptions, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and other inputs. The estimated growth rates for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts\nof anticipated future performance of the business. The residual value is estimated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-\nterm industry projections. The discount rates are calculated as the weighted average cost of capital of comparable peer companies, adjusted for company-specific risk. The market\napproach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which uses revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.\nWe performed the required annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units as of February 29, 2024, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, except for the\nDisplay reporting unit. As a result of this qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for the reporting units subject to\ntesting other than Display. In March 2024, we made the decision to exit the Display business by announcing the end of manufacturing of most Display products by December 31,\n2024, but we will continue to provide services to the installed base of Display products for existing customers. The exit of the business does not qualify as a discontinued operation\nunder the relevant accounting guidance, but the decision triggered a quantitative impairment assessment for the Display reporting unit, which resulted in a total goodwill impairment\ncharge of $\n70.5\n million in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nTo determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we utilized an income approach estimated through a discounted cash flow analysis, by adding the present value of the\nestimated annual discounted cash flows over a discrete projection period.

The employee\u2019s purchase price is derived from a formula based on the closing price of the common stock on the first day of the\noffering period versus the closing price on the date of purchase (or, if not a trading day, on the immediately preceding trading day).\nThe offering period (or length of the look-back period) under the ESPP has a duration of \nsix months\n, and the purchase price with respect to each offering period beginning on\nor after such date is, until otherwise amended, equal to \n85\n% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of our common stock at the commencement of the applicable \nsix-month\n offering\nperiod or (ii) the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using a Black-Scholes model.\nThe fair value of each purchase right under the ESPP was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and the straight-line attribution approach with the\nfollowing weighted-average assumptions:\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock purchase plan:\nExpected stock price volatility\n32.2\n \n%\n42.7\n \n%\n38.2\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n5.3\n \n%\n2.5\n \n%\n0.1\n \n%\nDividend yield\n1.1\n \n%\n1.6\n \n%\n1.2\n \n%\nExpected life (in years)\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\nThe following table shows total cash received from employees for the issuance of shares under the ESPP, the number of shares purchased by employees through the ESPP, the\ntax benefits realized by us in connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under the ESPP and the weighted-average fair value per share for the indicated\nperiods:\n(In thousands, except for weighted-average fair value per share)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal cash received from employees for the issuance of shares under the ESPP\n$\n144,934\n \n$\n124,731\n \n$\n113,015\n \nNumber of shares purchased by employees through the ESPP\n320\n \n418\n \n419\n \nTax benefits realized by us in connection with the disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased under\nthe ESPP\n$\n2,623\n \n$\n1,916\n \n$\n1,853\n \nWeighted-average fair value per share based on Black-Scholes model\n$\n125.04\n \n$\n89.52\n \n$\n94.35\n \nThe ESPP shares are replenished annually on the first day of each fiscal year by virtue of an evergreen provision.

Refer to Note 21 \u201cSubsequent\nEvents\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2024.\nNon-controlling Interests\nAs of June 30, 2022, we owned approximately \n94\n% of the outstanding equity interest of Orbograph, which was a non-core business engaged in the development and marketing\nof character recognition solutions to banks, financial and other payment processing institutions and healthcare providers. On August 11, 2022, we sold our interest in Orbograph; for\nfurther details, refer to Note 6 \u201cBusiness Combinations and Dispositions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 11 \u2014 \nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program that permits us to repurchase our common stock, including increases in the authorized repurchase amount of $\n2.00\n billion in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2022, $\n6.00\n billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and $\n2.00\n billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The stock repurchase program has no expiration\ndate and may be suspended at any time. The intent of the program is, in part, to mitigate the potential dilutive impact related to our equity incentive plans and shares issued in\nconnection with our ESPP as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders. Any and all share repurchase transactions are subject to market conditions and applicable legal\nrequirements.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Company executed accelerated share repurchase agreements (\u201cASR Agreements\u201d) with \ntwo\n financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common\nstock in exchange for an upfront payment of $\n3.00\n billion. The Company received initial deliveries totaling approximately \n6.5\n million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2022, which represented \n70\n% of the prepayment amount at the then prevailing market price of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock. The initial shares delivered were\nretired immediately upon settlement and treated as repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. The total number of shares received\nunder the ASR Agreements was based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less an agreed-upon\ndiscount. Final settlement of the ASR Agreements occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, resulting in the delivery of \n2.4\n million additional shares, which\nyielded an average share price of $\n333.88\n for the entire transaction.\nUnder the authoritative guidance, share repurchases are recognized as a reduction to retained earnings to the extent available, with any excess recognized as a reduction of\ncapital in excess of par value. In addition, as explained further in Note 14 \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d) introduced a 1% excise tax imposed on\ncertain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of treasury stock repurchased after\nDecember 31, 2022 and, as such, is included in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs of June 30, 2024, an aggregate of approximately $\n2.18\n billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program.\nShare repurchase transactions for the indicated periods (based on the trade date of the applicable repurchase), with fiscal 2022 excluding the $\n0.90\n billion portion of the ASR\nupfront payment that was recorded as an unsettled forward contract in fiscal 2022, were as follows:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of shares of common stock repurchased\n3,032\n \n5,844\n \n11,768\n \nTotal cost of repurchases\n$\n1,742,501\n \n$\n1,329,714\n \n$\n3,962,267\n \nNOTE 12 \u2014 \nNET INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "944b10f0-d361-4e49-aef9-ba951b3cf921": {"__data__": {"id_": "944b10f0-d361-4e49-aef9-ba951b3cf921", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "950884c91d2b3b2502cd04efb72ede9e977a4747b947537a624740ca385c4122", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e06ef4e3-b1e6-421c-b874-9fd20dbc3d47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "1cda6074837e813f4021c984093eb754bd30946063c3eb926ece5789d54d04cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Share repurchase transactions for the indicated periods (based on the trade date of the applicable repurchase), with fiscal 2022 excluding the $\n0.90\n billion portion of the ASR\nupfront payment that was recorded as an unsettled forward contract in fiscal 2022, were as follows:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of shares of common stock repurchased\n3,032\n \n5,844\n \n11,768\n \nTotal cost of repurchases\n$\n1,742,501\n \n$\n1,329,714\n \n$\n3,962,267\n \nNOTE 12 \u2014 \nNET INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod.

We have no defined benefit plans in the U.S. In addition to the profit sharing plan and the U.S. 401(k), several of our foreign subsidiaries have retirement plans\nfor their full-time employees, several of which are defined benefit plans. Consistent with the requirements of local law, our deposited funds for certain of these plans are held with\ninsurance companies, with third-party trustees or in government-managed accounts.

We also\nhad foreign capital loss carry-forwards of $\n8.6\n million as of June 30, 2024. The U.S. federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2025 through 2042. The\nutilization of NOLs created by acquired companies is subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, it is not expected that such annual\nlimitation will significantly impair the realization of these NOLs. The state NOLs will expire at various dates beginning in 2028 through 2036.

The change was primarily due to an increase\nin the valuation allowance related to state credit carry-forwards generated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more\nlikely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Of the valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024, $\n285.4\n million was related to federal and\nstate credit carry-forwards. The remainder of the valuation allowance was related to state and foreign NOL carry-forwards.\n As of June 30, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $\n185.9\n million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The CHIPS Act provides for various incentives and tax credits among other items, including the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (\u201cAMIC\u201d), which\nequals 25% of qualified investments in an advanced manufacturing facility that is placed in service after December 31, 2022. There was no material impact to our financial\nstatements from the AMIC provision.\nPresident Biden also signed into law the IRA on August 16, 2022. The IRA has several provisions including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) for\ncertain large corporations that have at least an average of $1.0 billion of adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The CAMT was effective for\nus beginning in our fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 and there was no tax impact to our financial statements from the CAMT provision.\nThe IRA also introduced a 1% excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies made after December 31, 2022. We began recording the\nexcise tax as part of the cost basis of treasury stock repurchased after December 31, 2022.\nOther than the AMIC and the excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases as mentioned above, we are currently evaluating the applicability and impact of the other\nprovisions in the IRA and the CHIPS Act on our Consolidated Financial Statements including our future cash flows.\nCalifornia Governor Newsom approved the 2024-25 California State Budget on June 27, 2024, which includes a provision to suspend the use of all net operating losses and\nlimits the use of R&D tax credits to $5 million for tax years 2024 through 2026.

Actions filed against us include\ncommercial, intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d), customer, and labor and employment related claims, including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action\nlawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws. In general, legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, and associated internal\ninvestigations (especially those relating to IP or confidential information disputes) are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct and may divert management\u2019s attention and\nother company resources. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome. We believe\nthe amounts provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities. However, because such matters are subject to many\nuncertainties and the ultimate outcomes are not predictable, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above\nwill not exceed the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements or will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash\nflows.\nNOTE 16 \u2014 \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFactoring.\n We have factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse.

In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be\nless in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.\nCash LTI Plan.\n As of June 30, 2024, we have committed $\n143.1\n million for future payment obligations under our Cash LTI Plan. Cash LTI awards issued to employees\nunder the Cash LTI Plan vest in \nthree\n or \nfour\n equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each anniversary of the grant\ndate over a \nthree\n or \nfour-year\n period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must be employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date.\nGuarantees and Contingencies. \nWe maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $\n83.9\n million, of which $\n49.9\n million had been\nissued as of June 30, 2024, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax and other operating requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries in Europe, Israel\nand Asia.\nIndemnification Obligations. \nSubject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain\nlitigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, applicable\ncontracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals\u2019 reasonable legal expenses and\npossibly damages and other liabilities incurred by several of our current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or\nreimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries. Although the\nmaximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited,\nwe believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise\nin connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising therefrom, or\nprovide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance\nspecifications, infringement by our products of third-party IP rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of\ncertain IP rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party\nmaking a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party\u2019s claims or, in case of\nbreach of IP representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these\nagreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and\nduration.

In accordance with the accounting guidance, we designate foreign currency forward transactions and options contracts and interest rate forward transactions as cash\nflow hedges. In accordance with the accounting guidance, we also designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as net investment hedge transactions intended to mitigate the\nvariability of the value of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.\nOur foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets. As a result, we are exposed to risks relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We\nutilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates that affect certain existing and forecasted foreign currency denominated\nsales and purchase transactions, such as the Japanese yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the new Israeli shekel.\nWe routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate\nfluctuations. These foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than \n18\n months. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness\nmonthly, based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives. If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise\nunable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material losses.\nSince fiscal 2015, we have entered into \nfive\n sets of Rate Lock Agreements to hedge the benchmark interest rate on portions of our Senior Notes prior to issuance. Upon\nissuance of the associated debt, the Rate Lock Agreements were settled and their fair values were recorded within AOCI. The resulting gains and losses from these transactions are\namortized to interest expense over the lives of the associated debt. As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate unamortized portion of the fair value of the Rate Lock Agreements was a $\n47.7\nmillion net gain.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same\nperiod or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative contracts executed after adopting the new accounting guidance in fiscal 2019, the election to\ninclude time value for the assessment of effectiveness is made on all forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in AOCI\nuntil the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The assessment of effectiveness of options contracts designated as cash flow hedges exclude time value. The initial value of the\ncomponent excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative contract. Any difference between change in the fair value of the\nexcluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in AOCI.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge in a foreign operation and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable\nto changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within AOCI. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings using the\nmark-to-market approach. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete\nliquidation or sale of the net investment in the hedged foreign operations.\nFor derivatives that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses are recognized in Other expense (income), net. We use foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign\ncurrency denominated assets or liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivative instruments are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being\nhedged.\nDerivatives in Hedging Relationships: Foreign

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about\nwhich separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nOur CODM is our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe have \nthree\n reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control; Specialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB and Component Inspection. The reportable segments are\ndetermined based on several factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.\nSemiconductor Process Control\nThe Semiconductor Process Control segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products, and related services, which helps IC\nmanufacturers achieve target yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production. Our differentiated products and services are\ndesigned to provide comprehensive solutions that help our customers accelerate development and production ramp cycles, achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields\nand improve their overall profitability. This reportable segment is comprised of \ntwo\n operating segments, Wafer Inspection and Patterning and GSS.\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process\nThe Specialty Semiconductor Process segment develops and sells advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty\nsemiconductor customers, including manufacturers of MEMS, radio frequency communication chips, and power semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications. This\nreportable segment is comprised of \none\n operating segment.\nPCB and Component Inspection\nThe PCB and Component Inspection segment enables electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs, FPDs and ICs to verify their quality, pattern the\ndesired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces. This reportable segment is comprised of \ntwo\noperating segments, PCB and Component Inspection.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\nin all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n102", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5119, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bfd255a-dcbd-4502-b322-198a3aaec9a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bfd255a-dcbd-4502-b322-198a3aaec9a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_106", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "019c643e94fc4684fc7aa963c9c993dcde9a9bd6fcd2ee1b72833c26c9d65364", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s arrangements with its customers include various combinations of products and services, which are\ngenerally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate\nperformance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price for each distinct product or service. Revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the\narrangement with each customer. Revenue is recognized from product sales at a point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring control of the\nproduct to the customer. Services revenue is recognized ratably over the period the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided or when the\nrelated service is performed. The Company\u2019s total revenues were $9,812.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing\nprocedures related to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the recording of product and services revenue at the\ntransaction consideration once control passes to the customer. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of revenue\nrecognized for a sample of product revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as purchase orders, sales orders, and proof of shipment; (ii) testing the\ncompleteness, accuracy, and occurrence of a sample of service revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as purchase orders, sales orders, and other\nevidence supporting the service period; and (iii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of June 30, 2024 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and\ninspecting source documents, such as invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 5, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1977.\n103", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3675, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe33c39e-94c9-410c-9f9d-df96c596c278": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe33c39e-94c9-410c-9f9d-df96c596c278", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf_part_107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/KLAC_10K-Q3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1191903, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "8b8a854c76b51b47d4e006c873fed347951cf5cdfb7e7a3a1fa7d3f5761b22c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SCHEDULE II\nValuation and Qualifying Accounts\n \n(In thousands)\nBalance at\nBeginning\nof Period\nCharged to\nExpense\nDeductions/\nAdjustments\nBalance\nat End\nof Period\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022:\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n$\n18,036\n \n$\n5,710\n \n$\n(\n3,115\n)\n$\n20,631\n \nAllowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n$\n204,433\n \n$\n8,096\n \n$\n31,900\n \n$\n244,429\n \nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023:\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n$\n20,631\n \n$\n19,894\n \n$\n(\n6,893\n)\n$\n33,632\n \nAllowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n$\n244,429\n \n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n14,743\n \n$\n259,172\n \nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024:\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n$\n33,632\n \n$\n5,912\n \n$\n(\n6,762\n)\n$\n32,782\n \nAllowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n$\n259,172\n \n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n30,362\n \n$\n289,534\n \nITEM \n9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM \n9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act (\u201cDisclosure Controls\u201d) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \u201cReport\u201d) required by Securities Exchange Act Rules\n13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b).

A\ncontrol system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design\nof a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be\ncircumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in\npart on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future\nconditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the\ninherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nITEM \n9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Adopted by Officers and \nDirectors\n During the Fourth Quarter\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the following officers of the Company \nadopted\n trading plans to sell and/or gift shares of our common stock that have been or\nwill be issued upon the vesting of RSUs, or purchased in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions set forth in Rule 10b5-\n1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act.

In particular, information appearing under \"Business,\"\n\"Risk Factors,\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" includes forward-looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and generally can be\nidentified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"continue,\" or\nsimilar expressions or future or conditional verbs.\nForward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in forward-looking statements.

In the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other jurisdictions, the\nregulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-\nconsuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the\ninnovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research\nand development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic\npharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can result in\nthe loss of a significant portion of the product's revenue in a very short period of time. Moreover, governments in some countries leverage\ngeneric entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures.\nFurther, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs.\nLaws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government\nprocedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing\nphysician expressly forbids it. In certain countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with\ngeneric or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after launch.\nBiosimilars\nA number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics\nunder the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly's\nbiologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an\napproved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an\nabbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on\nmany factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences\nfrom the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\nGlobally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed\nbiologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been\nlicensed under the BPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally\nmust expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be\nsubstituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear,\nand will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product\nthat is determined to be \"interchangeable\" by the FDA will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention\nof the healthcare provider who prescribed the original biologic product. The FDA requirements for interchangeability are evolving but the FDA\nhas issued several \"interchangeable\" designations for biosimilar products, including for competitive insulin products, and is expected to\ncontinue doing so in the future.\nRegulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and, therefore, the impact of these laws\non our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty.

We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries\nrelating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have\neffective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\nThe patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient\n(the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. These\npatents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).\nPatent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in\nthe \"Research and Development\" section below. In general, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years\nfrom the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments\nand restorations may extend the original patent term:\n\u2022Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is\ndelayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\u2022Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To\ncompensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical\nproduct may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is determined by a formula that cannot be calculated until\nproduct approval due to the uncertainty of the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There\nis a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some\ncountries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term restoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a\nregulatory agency. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an\nadditional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Also, in Japan, South Korea,\nAustralia, and other jurisdictions, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the length of regulatory review and\nother factors.\n9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4507, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ab5fc50-f7cb-4643-81eb-d52830495315": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ab5fc50-f7cb-4643-81eb-d52830495315", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "ccc9b58739dc8d52541e7a404033065e1e1c588f5c2ebfa0be0339c6f7d8f5f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market\nexclusivity for the product, often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator\ncompany may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the\nexpiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use\nor formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations\ngoverning these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\n\u2022Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in\nrecognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers\nfrom submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for\nthe drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the\nU.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on\nthe date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.\n\u2022Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an\napplication to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and\nefficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot\napprove a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.\n\u2022In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified\ntesting in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an\nadditional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of\nany relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity begins upon\nthe expiration of the relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity\u2014i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a\npatent right.\n\u2022Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a\ndisease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably\nexpected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the\nparticular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve\nanother marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric\nexclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a\nnumber of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Under the Trade-\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have\nagreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are\navailable to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of\n\"flexibilities\" allowed under the TRIPs Agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of\nmolecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not\nprovide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs Agreement.\nOur Intellectual Property Portfolio\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations\u2014particularly with respect to those\nproducts discussed below\u2014to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold\npatents on manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved\nproducts, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.\n10", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5148, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f65c5d-f117-438e-8486-b1f99410158d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f65c5d-f117-438e-8486-b1f99410158d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "faa79b7d68df2f85b8cffc453cb6200cbe9eddc51a5173f516e20513bc670ca1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The most relevant U.S. patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patent-protected\nmarketed products are as follows:\n\u2022Cyramza is protected by a compound patent and biologics data protection (2026).\n\u2022Emgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and biologics data protection (2030).\n\u2022Jardiance, and the related combination product Glyxambi, is protected by a compound patent (2028).\n\u2022Jaypirca is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2028).\n\u2022Mounjaro is protected by a compound patent (2036) and by data protection (2027).\n\u2022Olumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032).\n\u2022Retevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2025).\n\u2022Reyvow is protected by a compound patent (2030).\n\u2022Taltz is protected by a compound patent (2030) and by biologics data protection (2028).\n\u2022Trulicity is protected by a compound patent (2027) and by biologics data protection (2027).\n\u2022Verzenio is protected by a compound patent (2031).\nOutside the U.S., important patent protection or data protection includes:\n\u2022Baqsimi is protected by data protection in Japan (2026).\n\u2022Cyramza is protected by a compound patent (2028) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries, and by a compound\npatent (2026) and by data protection (2023) in Japan.\n\u2022Emgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and by data protection (2028) in major European countries, and by a compound\npatent (2035) and by data protection (2029) in Japan.\n\u2022Jardiance is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2029) and Japan (2030).\n\u2022Mounjaro is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2037) and Japan (2040).\n\u2022Olumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032) and by data protection (2027) in major European countries, and by a compound\npatent (2033) and by data protection (2025) in Japan.\n\u2022Retevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2031) in major European countries, and by a compound\npatent (2038) and by data protection (2029) in Japan.\n\u2022Reyvow is protected by data protection (2032) in major European countries, and a compound patent (2028) and by data protection\n(2032) in Japan.\n\u2022Taltz is protected by a compound patent (2031) and data protection (2027) in major European countries and a compound patent\n(2030) and data protection (2024) in Japan.\n\u2022Trulicity is protected by a compound patent (2029) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries and by a compound\npatent (2029) and by data protection (2023) in Japan.\n\u2022Verzenio is protected by a compound patent (2033) and data protection (2028) in major European countries and by a compound\npatent (2034) and data protection (2026) in Japan.\nThe following product candidates are the most relevant currently under regulatory review.

Trademark protection\nvaries throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is\nregistered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data\nprotection for a product.\nPatent Licenses and Collaborations\nMost of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and\ncollaboration agreements, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\nPatent Challenges\nIn the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes\nthe FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics, which are discussed below in more detail) when the\ngeneric manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the\ngeneric manufacturer must demonstrate only \"pharmaceutical equivalence\" and \"bioequivalence\" between the generic version and the New\nDrug Application (NDA)-approved-drug, not safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally\nstraightforward and inexpensive for the generic company.\nAbsent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire. However, after the\ninnovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the patents listed in\nthe innovator's NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a \"Paragraph IV certification.\" If the innovator\nresponds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer, the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company's application for a\n30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed\npatents are challenged, the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other\ngeneric manufacturers.\nGeneric manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic\ncompanies have shown willingness to launch \"at risk,\" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.\nUnder the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing\napproval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first\napproved. However, the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's\npatents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.\nThe patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the\nFDA, as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and\npatent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product\nprior to patent expiration. Further, in the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators' intellectual property\nhas increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. See also \"\u2014Competition\u2014Biosimilars.\" In addition, there is a procedure in\nU.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the\nreview of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard\nof proof than used in federal district court.

In\naddition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare\nproviders and suppliers, the environment, occupational health and safety, data privacy, and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have\nintensified governmental scrutiny of our operations, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), quality\nassurance, and similar regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the\ndiscovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses will continue to require substantial effort, expense, and capital\ninvestment.\nOf particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the\ntesting, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of\ninformation, and post-marketing surveillance of those products and devices.\nFollowing approval, our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling, import, export, storage,\nrecordkeeping, advertising, promotion, and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products\nwe sell. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur\nafter a product reaches the market. The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are\nplaced on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the\napproved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nOutside the U.S., our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the EMA in Europe, the Ministry of\nHealth, Labor and Welfare in Japan, and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from\ncountry to country. Regulatory and compliance requirements, as well as approval processes outside the U.S., may differ from those in the\nU.S. and may involve additional costs, uncertainties, and risks.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under\ntheir cGMP regulations. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide\nquality systems and controls in our manufacturing, product development, and process development operations in an effort to maintain\nsustained compliance with cGMP and other regulations. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to\npotential government investigations, regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production\nleading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or\nsupplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our\nbusiness. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties, and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect\nus, including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications. Any determination by the FDA or\nother regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may\naffect our research, development or production efforts.\n13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4934, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163141fd-2d0d-457d-a782-9529186bc58b": {"__data__": {"id_": "163141fd-2d0d-457d-a782-9529186bc58b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "c0f4c08fc6b220751e93354ecc9baa8b15dc0498349fd590e0f8dec08396ad8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Emergency Use Authorizations\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue an EUA to authorize unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of\napproved medical products, to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been\ndesignated by the government.

In May and November 2022, respectively, the FDA announced that bamlanivimab and\netesevimab are, and bebtelovimab is, not currently authorized for emergency use for any U.S. region.\nOther Laws and Regulations\nThe marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact\nwith purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, as well as analogous foreign laws and\nregulations, including the federal anti-kickback statute, the False Claims Act, and state laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade\npractices, and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector\nGeneral of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and state\nattorneys general. State, federal, and foreign governments, agencies, and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight, enforcement\nactivities, and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies, which has resulted in intensified scrutiny, litigation costs, corporate\ncriminal sanctions, and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S. publicly traded companies,\nfrom promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose\nof helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and\ninternal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves\nsignificant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe\npharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions\nwith these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.\nIn addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have\nlaws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions have\nenhanced their laws and regulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border\ncoordination and information sharing.\nWe are, and could in the future become, subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil\npenalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from\nU.S. federal and other healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on\nour consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position in any given period.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may\naffect our research, development, or production efforts.\n14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4608, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f621f1c-ccb1-4351-aaf6-df56e3391178": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f621f1c-ccb1-4351-aaf6-df56e3391178", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "0afbb5a12ba7490c5d454fddedf3d07caf0658505b4feba8f14f1cf3bfbdcb16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\nU.S.\nThere continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S. government actions to reduce\nfederal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services associated with\nthe provision of our products.\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will require the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare\nPart B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under an NDA) or thirteen (medicines approved\nunder a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to\nrepresent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will\nset these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be\nselected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement\nfor certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The establishment of payment\nlimits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us.\nOther IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a\nrate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a\nnew manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil\nmonetary penalties, which could be significant.\nThe IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully\ninfluence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved\nunder an NDA may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor\u2019s product\nbeing selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full\nimpact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\nHeightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products has also resulted in several\nCongressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to\nproduct pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement\nmethodologies for drug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product\ncandidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFor example, in April 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the\nTreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease national coverage determination (the Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD) limiting coverage of FDA-\napproved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicare only if they are\nenrolled in qualifying clinical trials. In its current form, the Alzheimer\u2019s Monoclonal Antibody NCD would result in significantly reduced\ncoverage for, and negatively impact, our product candidate donanemab, and may negatively impact our business and financial results.\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the current U.S.\npresidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and\nconsolidated results of operations.\n15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4424, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "573885a9-afa6-4c80-9a13-acb892a28842": {"__data__": {"id_": "573885a9-afa6-4c80-9a13-acb892a28842", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_15", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "ff7f948beb519c76d4b2cc4126e6bd85dee2e416c9304ac20524892909570558", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the U.S., we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals\nunder various federal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1\npercent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in\ncertain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally, an\nannual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government\nprograms. Since 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to provide a\ndiscount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the \"doughnut hole\" (the\ncoverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). Beginning in October 2024, under the IRA the 70 percent discount will be replaced by\na 10 percent discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a\n$2,000 threshold and a 20 percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold.\nRebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered\nby Medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of\ncompetitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug\nbenefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute's discount safe\nharbor, which have currently been stayed until at least January 1, 2032.\nFor a discussion of risks related to how we price our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014We face\nlitigation and investigations related to our products, how we price our products, and how we commercialize our products; we could face large\nnumbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\"\nOutside the U.S.\nGlobally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative\neffectiveness and value, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party\norganizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, conduct and publish\ncomparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which are uncertain.\nIn most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price\ncontrols, international reference pricing (to other countries' prices), discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often\ngeneric, pharmaceutical choices), restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. In October 2022, the\nGerman Parliament passed cost cutting reforms and these reforms were followed by activation of a clawback mechanism in France and\nimplementation of increased mandatory rebates in the United Kingdom. These changes may be followed in 2023 by biopharmaceutical-\nfocused austerity measures in more countries in Europe and in other markets. Reforms, including those that may stem from periods of\neconomic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the\nRussia-Ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic), may continue to result in\nadded pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer\ndevelopments.

We invest heavily in research and development because we\nbelieve it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 9,000 people in pharmaceutical\nresearch and development activities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and\nhighly skilled technical personnel.\nOur internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of obesity & diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. At the\noutset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to\ndiscovering and developing new medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and\ntherapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.\nTo supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations worldwide to\nconduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we\nbelieve complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing\narrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments.\nPharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately\nbecome approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of\nthe process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following\ndescribes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:\nPhases of New Drug Development\n\u2022Discovery Phase\nIn the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets\nthought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet\nother design criteria move to the next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and\nsafety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate\nbecoming a medicine is extremely low.\n\u2022 Early Development Phase\nEarly development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is\ninitially performed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are\nconducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of\npatients are studied (Phase II) to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify\nsafe, effective, and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the\ncandidates that enter the early development phase, approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early\ndevelopment phase varies but can take several years to complete.\n\u2022 Late Development Phase\nLate phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in\nearlier studies. As a result, these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to\ndemonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new\nmedicine and may be compared to competitive therapies, placebo, or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are\ndesigned to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to\nfour years.\n17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9e677c8-03e0-4722-bbf9-b30319162552": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9e677c8-03e0-4722-bbf9-b30319162552", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "19bb0e74187f0a5173183d6ba02f64dac87b2824b9094ecb273ac0fb0a382b7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022 Submission Phase\nOnce a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to\nseveral years, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of available data, the degree of unmet need, and the time\nrequired for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors.\nThere is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications\nwill be consistent across geographic areas.\nWe believe our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others, have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new\nmedicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development. We have a number of new medicine candidates in clinical\ndevelopment or under regulatory review, and we have a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7, \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis\u2014Executive Overview\u2014Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more information on our late-stage product candidates.\nRaw Materials and Product Supply\nMost of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain\nraw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an\nalternative source of supply can be implemented, in the event one of these suppliers becomes unable to provide the materials or product.\nHowever, various developments have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources,\nimplement alternative processes, bring new manufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets.\nThe majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing\noccurs at sites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery\ndevice manufacturing, and packaging, take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active\ningredient manufacturing and finishing operations.\nWe manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to\nmeet substantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and\nrespond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use a variety of techniques, including comprehensive\nquality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.\nHowever, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding\nmanufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory\napprovals. Accordingly, developments such as unplanned plant shutdowns, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our\nfacilities or contracted facilities, failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, increases in demand\non a supplier, or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors have led, and may in the future\nlead, to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products, product shortages, or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one\nor more markets. Further, global transportation and logistics challenges, cost inflation, and tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future\nmay cause, delays in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines, the construction or acquisition of manufacturing\ncapacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. For more information on the additional risks we face in\nconnection with any difficulties, disruptions, and shortages in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk\nFactors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Manufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could lead to product\nsupply problems.\"\nIn addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19\npandemic and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic\ndownturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to\nhave, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines.

We believe the strength of our workforce significantly\ncontributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance, most of the products\nwe sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover\nor acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our\ntalented colleagues helps drive our success.\nWe are committed to creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital\nmanagement process, fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, robust training and development opportunities, and\ncompetitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within our company reflects our\nvalues and is a key driver of business success and growth.\nWe regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed\nand analyzed by our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of\nour efforts, we believe that we have a highly performing, cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.\nAt the end of 2022, we employed approximately 39,000 people, including approximately 21,000 employees outside the U.S. Our employees\ninclude approximately 9,000 people engaged in research and development activities.\nStrategy and Oversight\nIn order to build diverse and inclusive teams, our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders\naccountable for achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance,\nour board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital\nmanagement initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract, retain, engage, and develop a\nworkforce that aligns with our values and mission.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nWe are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, and we deeply value diverse backgrounds, skills, and\nglobal perspectives. To fulfill our purpose, we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse\nexperiences of the patients who depend on us.\nWe believe that fostering DEI begins with understanding. For example, our Employee Journeys research has yielded important insights about\nthe experiences of women, Black/African American, Latinx, Asian, and LGBTQ+ employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed\nby our senior leadership, and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture.\nIn 2020, as part of our DEI and community initiatives, Lilly and the Lilly Foundation launched the Racial Justice Commitment, with Lilly\npledging 25,000 volunteer hours and the Lilly Foundation committing $25 million over five years to help decrease the burden of racial\ninjustice and its effects on communities of color. The Racial Justice Commitment aims to drive change across five areas: internal people\ndevelopment, health equity, social impact, diversity partners, and family sustaining jobs, through the use of financial and people resources.\nFrom 2020 through 2022, we have made progress in these efforts, including nearly tripling our spending with Black-owned businesses,\ncommitting over $98 million in minority-led venture capital firms, serving over 30,000 volunteer hours to advance racial justice initiatives, and\nexpanding our Skills First Program at Lilly for individuals without four-year college degrees.\nSince 2017, we have committed to increasing women, Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian representation in leadership roles, and we\nactively monitor our progress. From the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we increased the percentage of women in management\nglobally from 42 percent to 49 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period, we increased management\nrepresentation from 19 percent to 25 percent. Across all levels of our workforce, from the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we have seen\nincreased representation for MGMs in the U.S. and women globally. Our focus on DEI is also evident at our executive committee and board\nof directors.

We therefore require hiring managers to consider a\ndiverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps\nensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers.\nIn early 2022, we launched Discover, a 12-month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration\ninto Lilly, to accelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at Lilly. Discover was shaped in\npart by external benchmarking, feedback from employees, and learnings from onboarding remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that\npromotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences, helping them build rewarding\ncareers. We have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings in addition to our in-person\nprograms. Many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly, we\nare continuously working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective. In addition, we have implemented development\ntools and resources for all employees, improved our talent programs and processes to provide broader access to information, and increased\ntransparency regarding career development and advancement at Lilly.\nEmployee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 11 ERGs representing\ngroups including women, MGMs, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities\nto build relationships, engage with senior leaders, advance our caring community, and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our\nbusiness.\nWe have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share\ntheir ideas at work. Our Make it Safe to Thrive education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand\nhow individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training. In late 2022, we introduced a new\nversion of Make it Safe to Thrive for leaders that continues to focus on psychological safety and creating an inclusive environment. Leaders\nare provided the opportunity to work through challenging conversations and situations currently being navigated in the workplace.\nLilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace\u2014an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or\nretaliation of any kind. In 2022, as part of our annual review of The Red Book and related policies and procedures, we revised the Global\nConduct in the Workplace procedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful, safe, inclusive, and professional workplace.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWe strive to foster a healthy, vibrant work environment, which includes keeping our employees safe. We seek to create a companywide\nculture where best-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this, we assess and continuously attempt to improve our\ncompanywide safety performance to promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate. As the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has evolved, we have continued to take various measures (as necessary) to protect and support the health and safety\nof our employees globally.

Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in\nevaluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected by any of these risks. Certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or\nacquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will\nlose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. \nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, the introduction of new products,\nand business development activities to enhance our product pipeline.\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can\ntake over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after\nsubstantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates\nthat appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or\nsafety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of\npricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or\nbetter competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of\nothers. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays, uncertainties,\nunpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches,\nlost market opportunity, potential impairment of inventories, and other negative impacts. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict\nrevenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially\ngranted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product\ncandidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or line extensions for existing products,\nboth through our internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and\ndevelopment costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual\nproperty exclusivity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nWe engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-\ndevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. There are substantial risks\nassociated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions.

Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful\nthird-party challenges. We have faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual\nproperty protection. For example, following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have\nfaced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue\nto erode revenue from current levels in these markets. In addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the\nexpiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity for Alimta in in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic\ncompetition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current\nlevels.\nCertain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic\nproducts, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results\nin the entry of one or more generic competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the U.S. For biologics\n(such as Humalog, Humulin, Erbitux, Cyramza, Trulicity, Taltz, and Emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term\nentry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or\nuncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the competitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also\nintroduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.\nThere is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if\nchallenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from\nemploying alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition,\ncompetitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or\nallege a third-party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property.

In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO\nwithout the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the\nBPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR\nproceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. Recently,\nthe USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court\nlitigation. However, it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after\ninstitution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process, even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity\nof our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court, meaning the\nsame patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as\nwell. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition, competitors or other third\nparties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful, such claims could\nresult in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or\nroyalties on future sales. In addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face\nadditional risks to our intellectual property rights, including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively\nshortly after launch. See Item 1, \"Business\u2014Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" and Item 8, \"Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 16: Contingencies,\" for more details.\n\u2022We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and\nlower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical\ncompanies and, in many cases, our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete\nsuccessfully, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our\nproduct revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the\nmarketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the\nsame therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations, including new\nmodalities, that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.\nRegulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing\ninterpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars, health authority guidelines and\nlegislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of\nbiosimilars. In the U.S., the FDA has issued several \"interchangeability\" designations for biosimilar products, and is expected to continue\ndoing so in the future. These designations could \u2013 subject to state law requirements \u2013 enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for\ninnovator biological products. Given the importance of biologic products to our clinical-stage pipeline, such regulation could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. See Item 1, \"Business\u2014Competition\" and \"Business\u2014Research and Development,\" for more\ndetails.\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively.

Additionally, some customers, including governments or other\nentities reliant upon government funding, may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also, if our customers,\nsuppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt\nexpense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners.

For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and\nsanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. As a further example, the\nfinancial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and inflation due, in part, to the Russia-Ukraine war and resulting geopolitical\nand economic disruptions, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments\nwith single-payer or government funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other\nreforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe.

These\nclaims relate to how we commercialize and/or how we price our products, including relating to our 340B drug pricing program, as well as\ncontractual matters and other disputes. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 16: Contingencies\" for more\ninformation on our current product liability litigation, as well as pricing and other litigation, investigations, and inquiries. Because of the\nnature of pharmaceutical products, we are, and could in the future become, subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our\nprevious, current, or future products, or to further litigation or investigations, including related to pricing or other commercial practices.\nSuch matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and, if involving marketed\nproducts, could adversely affect sales of the product and our consolidated results of operations in any given period. Due to a very\nrestrictive market for liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all of our currently marketed products, as well\nas for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.\n\u2022Manufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could lead to product supply problems. \nPharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated.

In select cases, supply constraints may also lead to pauses, discontinuations or other product\navailability issues in one or more markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash\nflows. Further, cost inflation and global transportation and logistics challenges, as well as tight labor markets, have caused, and in the\nfuture may cause, delays in, and/or increase costs related to, distribution of our medicines, the construction or other acquisition of\nmanufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. Such difficulties, disruptions, or\nchallenges could result from quality, oversight, or regulatory compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances of\nnatural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change), public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics (such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic); periods of global economic downturn or uncertainty; emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest\n(including the Russia-Ukraine war); equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities, such as system inadequacies, inadequate\ncontrols or procedures, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from\na variety of sources; labor shortages; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; or inability to obtain single-\nsource or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and\nsupply. For example, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis,\nreagents, starting materials, and ingredients.\nDifficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for\nthe expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted, and in the future may result, in\ndifficulty meeting demand for, or disruptions, shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. For example, we have\nexperienced challenges in meeting demand for our incretin products, partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies.\nDespite our ongoing efforts to meet significant expected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity,\nthere can be no assurances that such capacity increases will be realized as expected. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional\nmanufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on expected demand. Conversely, unexpected contingencies that limit demand\nfor our incretin products would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred,\nand expect to continue to incur, to augment manufacturing capacity and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations. The\nforegoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation.

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take\nover a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial\ninvestment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear\npromising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns,\ninability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited\nscope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products,\ndifficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies\nestablish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and\ninconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market\nopportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.\nWe manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in, or termination of, any one\nproject will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties\ninvolved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to\ncomplete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be\ngenerated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is\nindividually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development\ncosts on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data\nthat are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to\nreport on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.\u00ae\n(1)(2)\n\u00ae(2)\n(2)\n\u00ae\n(1) \n(2) \n41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4202, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71bbad14-f14e-4e08-a335-5671e6488890": {"__data__": {"id_": "71bbad14-f14e-4e08-a335-5671e6488890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "e4d592ee44ae1a6ba6ec0d86c286d75278efd479c7640a51391d06d7832d3eca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Other Matters\nPatent Matters\nWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings.\nFollowing the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has\nrapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in\nthese markets.

Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price\nreporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as\nother efforts. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will\nrequire the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed\nunder Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or\nthirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory\nceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell\nhow the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our\nsignificant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of\nreducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nThe establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly\nimpact us.\nOther IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a\nrate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a\nnew manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil\nmonetary penalties, which could be significant.\nThe IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully\ninfluence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved\nunder a new drug application may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a\ncompetitor's product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other\nreformation, and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\u00ae\n\u00ae\n42", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4876, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5f5e9bd-9ac9-4fc3-81b7-41d0ebc25120": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5f5e9bd-9ac9-4fc3-81b7-41d0ebc25120", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_42", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "6ae07652384297e56242d3a10561a91e33074ec4c9d24479482dba27fc639096", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed and/or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the current U.S.\npresidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nConsolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for\npharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates.\nFurthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by\ngovernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' national coverage\ndetermination for monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, may adversely impact our business and consolidated\nresults of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, such as insulin, as\ngovernments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in\nlitigation and investigations related to our 340B program and access to insulin that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our\nbusiness and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general\npharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, evolving standards, and\nincreased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable\nforeign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties,\ninterruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product\napprovals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of\nwhich would adversely affect our business. Moreover, increased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead\nto impediments to the completion of business combinations.\nSee Item 1, \"Business\u2014Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\" and Note 16\nto the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProduct Supply\nWe have faced challenges, and expect to continue to face challenges, meeting strong demand for our incretin products, including due to the\nlimited and fluctuating availability of competitor therapies. In the U.S., given very strong uptake of Mounjaro following its launch in the U.S. for\ntype 2 diabetes in the second quarter of 2022, and as demand for Trulicity has remained strong, we have experienced intermittent delays in\nfulfilling certain U.S. orders for these products. Outside the U.S., we have implemented certain actions to minimize the impact on existing\nTrulicity patients, but we expect to continue to experience intermittent disruptions in our supply of Trulicity in international markets.\nWe anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist until additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. We expect\nadditional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years, with\nsignificant expansion in 2023, as part of our ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines.\nTax Matters\nWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic\nand international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. In 2017,\nthe U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which contained a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of\nresearch and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred.\nThe implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the\nimplementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from\n2022 levels over the five-year amortization period.\u00ae\n43", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4693, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cbec14d-4fb1-4f37-9a2d-2b2fd8e4ca57": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cbec14d-4fb1-4f37-9a2d-2b2fd8e4ca57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_43", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "9564514a756cf330ef7b821b813d3acd981869828a35908136c436c80376ba31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-\nrelated matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could\ninfluence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely\nexamine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions. Changes to existing\nU.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future\nconsolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates and Other Impacts\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the\neuro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management\ntechniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of\noperations in any given period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was unfavorably impacted by 3 percent due to foreign\nexchange rates. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates have, and we\ncurrently expect in the near-term future will, adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19\npandemic and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic\ndownturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to\nhave, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines.\nAcquisitions\nWe invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take\nmany forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as\na way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we remain focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting the\nmedical system and our communities; and affordability of and access to our medicines. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also\nfocused on researching, developing, and supplying COVID-19 therapies, although we do not currently expect significant further revenue\nattributable to treatments for COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to\nvarying and fluctuating degrees, including as a result of cost inflation and strain on the global transportation, manufacturing, and labor\nmarkets, fewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain\nmarkets, pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies resulting from the financial strain of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems, and risks related to our COVID-19 therapies. The degree to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control.\nFor additional information, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risk Related to Our Business\u2014Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics,\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and operations.\"\nSee Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations.\n44", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4213, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b490cec-ea9a-411d-8e94-1f775839f772": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b490cec-ea9a-411d-8e94-1f775839f772", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_44", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "e41ef492cb4170aca05ec26092595bb2042e8fb5b9d5b4356d5b89b6a8c78f23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Results\u20142022\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 Percent Change\nU.S. $ 18,190.0 $ 16,811.0 8\nOutside U.S. 10,351.3 11,507.4 (10)\nRevenue $ 28,541.4 $ 28,318.4 1\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nThe following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year:\n2022 vs. 2021\nU.S. Outside U.S. Consolidated\nVolume 11 % 9 % 10 %\nPrice (3)% (10)% (6)%\nForeign exchange rates \u2014 % (8)% (3)%\nPercent change 8 % (10)% 1 %\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\nIn the U.S. the increase in volume in 2022 was primarily driven by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Mounjaro, and Taltz, partially offset by\ndecreased volume for Alimta, following the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022.

Some of those\njudgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual\nestimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could\ndevelop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable\njudgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods\npresented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations\nand other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the\nrelated product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to\na direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the\ndistribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales\nrebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback\nprograms, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual\namount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a\npercentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an\nevaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product\npricing.\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount\naccruals.\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties,\nupfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and\ncircumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales\nreturn liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31,\n2022, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately\n$464 million.\nThe portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately\n90 percent as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed\ncare, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:\n(Dollars in millions) 2022 2021\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 6,161.6 $ 5,400.0 \nReduction of net sales 28,398.4 20,106.3 \nCash payments (26,345.9) (19,344.7)\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 8,214.1 $ 6,161.6 \nAdjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.\nIncrease in reduction of net sales in 2022 was primarily driven by our incretin products due to increase in our patient assistance programs\nand in volume of rebates for managed care, Medicare and Medicaid programs.(1)\n(1) \n52", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4512, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0197f86c-1a05-4929-bd0e-d858e05cee56": {"__data__": {"id_": "0197f86c-1a05-4929-bd0e-d858e05cee56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "ef06134d96d31e9e0511083d670f4c2752ad74ae7bc1d6816bc05353d00f189d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies\nBackground and Uncertainties\nLitigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors\nwe consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the\nlitigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the\nscience subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition,\nwe accrue for certain liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily\non historical claims experience and data regarding product usage.\nWe also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance\ncoverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial\ncondition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance,\nwe are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any\nthird-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights,\nthese considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and\nlength of time for collection.\nThe litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as\nliabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAcquisitions\nBackground and Uncertainties\nTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition,\nwe make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a\nbusiness under the relevant accounting rules.\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be\nrecorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over\nthe fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet\nthe definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an\nalternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D and development milestones on our consolidated statement of operations at the\nacquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as\nwell as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including\nacquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed\nreasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue\nprojections, and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation\nexpert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an \"income method,\" as described in Note 8 to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted\ncash flow analysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration\nrequires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success and the discount rate.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income\ntaxes of $5.5 million.\n53", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4687, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0b50750-7b93-48e5-802b-c86d4f3fe653": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0b50750-7b93-48e5-802b-c86d4f3fe653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_53", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "a9b9a1a0fa4effc4c9aa58828f76d49ad2cc5d78201beb37bc20ea5dee484cfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment\nby comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is\nidentified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are\npresent, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less\nthan its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that\ncompares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.\nSeveral methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize\nthe \"income method,\" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nFor acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets\nultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in \"\u2014Executive Overview\u2014Late-Stage Pipeline.\" The nature of the\npharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved\nproducts. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.\nEstimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require\nmanagement's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.\nRetirement Benefits Assumptions\nBackground and Uncertainties\nDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,\nand retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to\nthe consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.\nAnnually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit\nplans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount\nrates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market\nconditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial\nadvisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and\nexpected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider\nthe retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.\nAnnually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50\npercent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these\nalternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as\nnecessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for\ncurrency, credit, liquidity and other risks.\n54", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ee387fb-b730-4e62-aa4b-a05b80e5c007": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ee387fb-b730-4e62-aa4b-a05b80e5c007", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "669e17e503b75ab1bb5205d2987d9ddb26670f57f641baff490210fd5b636e62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Financial Statement Impact\nIf the 2022 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter\npercentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.8 million.

If our assumption regarding the 2022\nexpected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $46.3 million.\nThe U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 85 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan\nassets at December 31, 2022.\nAdjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments\noccur. Such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining\nservice life of employees.\nIncome Taxes\nBackground and Uncertainties\nWe file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon\nthese interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination\nby taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of\nmany tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than\nnot that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\nbenefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50\npercent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and\ncircumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax\nexamination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to\npay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net\noperating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more\nlikely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these\ncarryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax\nassets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances\nand a reduction of income tax expense.\nFinancial Statement Impact\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change\nin net income of $85.0 million and $38.8 million, respectively.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nInformation relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by\nreference.\nItem 7A.

Statements\nELI LILLY AND COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Tables present dollars in millions, except per-share data)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include Eli Lilly and Company and all subsidiaries and have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We consider majority voting interests, as well as\neffective economic or other control over an entity when deciding whether or not to consolidate an entity. We generally do not have control by\nmeans other than voting interests. Where our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling\nshareholders' interests are reflected as a separate component of equity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We issued our financial statements by filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) and have evaluated subsequent events up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with\nthe current presentation.\nWe operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of pharmaceutical\nproducts worldwide. A global research and development organization and a supply chain organization are responsible for the discovery,\ndevelopment, manufacturing, and supply of our products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute, and sell the products. The\nbusiness is also supported by global corporate staff functions. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent with the\nfinancial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources,\nsetting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) and Development Milestones\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in performing\nresearch and development activities, including but not limited to, compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial\nexpense and fees paid to contract research organizations.\nAcquired IPR&D and development milestones include the initial costs of externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a\ntransaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use. Additionally, milestone payment obligations related\nto these transactions that are incurred prior to regulatory approval of the compound are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to\npay the milestone occurs.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS)\nAll per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, are presented on a diluted basis. We calculate basic EPS based on the\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from potential participating securities. We\ncalculate diluted EPS based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from our\nstock-based compensation programs.\n61", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3780, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b87fdab-d3fa-452a-996a-4462bf9a2198": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b87fdab-d3fa-452a-996a-4462bf9a2198", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "17b36f338cd8548a3276e06ce73475faecc6dc47d789632d9ad97c6c48830cc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Foreign Currency Translation\nOperations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined\nby a review of the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash.

The standard is currently applicable to contracts entered into\nbefore January 1, 2025. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2022. The adoption did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 2: Revenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statements of operations:\n2022 2021 2020\nNet product revenue $ 25,462.8 $ 25,957.9 $ 22,694.8 \nCollaboration and other revenue 3,078.6 2,360.5 1,845.0 \nRevenue $ 28,541.4 $ 28,318.4 $ 24,539.8 \nCollaboration and other revenue associated with prior period transfers of intellectual property was $163.4 million, $175.0 million, and $135.6 million during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations\nand other arrangements. Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the\ncollaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.

Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment\nterms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been\nadjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the\nproduct and when we receive payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments\nmade after the due date. Provisions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are\nrecognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are received; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but\nnot yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not\nconsidered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a\ngovernmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 21 percent of\nconsolidated revenue. Further, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 29 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021.\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts,\nand returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\nSales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\u2022We initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various\nrebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our\nproduct sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to\nthe direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required\nin making these estimates.\n\u2022The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that\nrequire the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term\ncare, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value\napproach.\n\u2022The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare,\nMedicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In\ndetermining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient\nassistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g.,\npatent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that\nare sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs\nat the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in\nany particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.\n\u2022Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period\nas the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical\npayments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized\nin the same period as the related sale.\n63", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b876348-93c0-40f4-8be0-b27d151e8b76": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b876348-93c0-40f4-8be0-b27d151e8b76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "0579a71ba478f923edffd316017b1cfd920d335c6ada7ed1ec5453b7cc372edd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\n\u2022When product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserve for future product\nreturns related to those sales using an expected value approach. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical\nreturn rates, expiration date by product (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and\nestimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically identified anticipated returns due\nto known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuations, or a changing competitive environment.\nWe maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return most of our products for dating issues within a specified\nperiod prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we\nexpect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels\nexpires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our\nassumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Once the product is returned, it is\ndestroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictive than in the\nU.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserve for future\nproduct returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n\u2022As a part of our process to estimate a reserve for product returns, we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products at\nthe major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by\nour major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to\nmaintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product\nportfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns,\nanticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In\nthe U.S., the current structure of our arrangements provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers; however, our data\non inventory levels in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any\nmaterial changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n\u2022Actual U.S. product returns have been less than 2 percent of our U.S. revenue during each of the past three years and have not\nfluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusivity\nfor major products in the U.S. market.\nAdjustments to Revenue\nAdjustments to increase revenue, recognized as a result of changes in estimates for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates, and\ndiscounts liability balances for products shipped in previous periods, were less than 1 percent of U.S. revenue during each of the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nCollaboration and Other Arrangements\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately\nbelow and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other\narrangements are not contracts with customers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with\ncustomers.\n\u2022Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of\nrevenue (e.g., royalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\n\u2022Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized\nas collaboration and other revenue as earned.\n\u2022Royalty revenue from licensees and certain of our collaboration partners, which is based on sales to third-parties of licensed\nproducts and technology, is recorded when the third-party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the\nroyalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). This royalty revenue is included in collaboration and other\nrevenue.\n64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4712, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "137d3ae7-c421-49b6-930c-502732908eb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "137d3ae7-c421-49b6-930c-502732908eb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_64", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "c9582eea7a27bd7b8274bb7fa220a1fef421448ac33bda8fa63dcb7302865b00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022For arrangements involving multiple goods or services (e.g., research and development, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and\ndistribution), each required good or service is evaluated to determine whether it is distinct.

arrangements. In connection with these arrangements, our partners may be entitled to future royalties and/or\ncommercial milestones based on sales should products be approved for commercialization and/or milestones based on the successful\nprogress of compounds through the development process.\nIn December 2022, January 2021, and February 2020, we completed the acquisitions of Akouos, Inc. (Akouos), Prevail Therapeutics Inc.\n(Prevail), and Dermira, Inc. (Dermira), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were\naccounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination\nof estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair\nvalue of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has been recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been\nincluded in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2022, 2021, and 2020, which are further discussed below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each\nacquisition, the cost allocated to acquired IPR&D was immediately expensed if the compound has no alternative future use. Milestone\npayment obligations incurred prior to regulatory approval of the compound are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the\nmilestone occurs. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $908.5 million, $970.1 million, and $769.8 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nAcquisitions of Businesses\nAkouos Acquisition\nOverview of Transaction\nIn December 2022, we acquired all shares of Akouos for a purchase price that included $12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of\n$327.2 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles the Akouos\nshareholders up to an additional $3.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable, subject to certain terms\nand conditions, upon the achievement of certain specified milestones.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potential gene therapy treatments for hearing loss and other inner ear conditions. The lead\ngene therapies in clinical development that we acquired included GJB2 (which encodes connexin 26) for a common form of monogenic\ndeafness and hearing loss; AK-OTOF for hearing loss due to mutations in the otoferlin gene; AK-CLRN1 for Usher Type 3A, an autosomal\nrecessive disorder characterized by progressive loss of both hearing and vision; and AK-antiVEGF for vestibular schwannoma.(1)\n(1) \n67", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3511, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd63f061-bf71-4f54-ae1e-869ee2956630": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd63f061-bf71-4f54-ae1e-869ee2956630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "c0632f01605bea5f8a84e70d5461442d471f69c5b1e3af637c3cc8212d954384", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nOur access to Akouos information was limited prior to the acquisition. As a consequence, we are in the process of determining fair values\nand tax bases of a significant portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the identification and valuation of intangible\nassets and tax exposures. The final determination of these amounts will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from\nthe acquisition date.

The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00\nper share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory\napproval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the\nfull value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31,\n2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire\nwithout payment.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with\nneurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition established a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts\nthrough the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical\ndevelopment that we acquired were PR001 for patients with Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease\nand PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations.

The number of PA shares actually issued, if\nany, varies depending on the achievement of certain pre-established earnings-per-share targets over a two-year period.

The number of shares actually issued, if any,\nvaries depending on our stock price at the end of the three-year vesting period compared to pre-established target stock prices. We measure\nthe fair value of the SVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model utilizes multiple input variables that\ndetermine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. Expected\nvolatilities utilized in the model are based on implied volatilities from traded options on our stock, historical volatility of our stock price, and\nother factors.

However, within individual investment manager mandates, restrictions and limitations are\ncontractually set to align with our investment objectives, ensure risk control, and limit concentrations.\nWe manage our portfolio to minimize concentration of risk by allocating funds within asset categories.

Derivatives are principally used to increase or decrease exposure to a particular public equity, fixed income, commodity, or\ncurrency market more rapidly or less expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the cash markets. The plans utilize both\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter instruments. The maximum exposure to either a market or counterparty credit loss is limited to the\ncarrying value of the receivable, and is managed within contractual limits. We expect all of our counterparties to meet their obligations. The\ngross values of these derivative receivables and payables are not material to the global asset portfolio, and their values are reflected within\nthe tables below.\nThe defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 75\npercent growth investments and 25 percent fixed-income investments. The growth investment allocation encompasses U.S. and international\npublic equity securities, hedge funds, private equity-like investments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce\noverall risk by providing diversification, while seeking moderate to high returns over the long term.\nPublic equity securities are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across various asset managers\nand styles. The remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private alternative investments.\nFixed-income investments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations,\ncorporate bonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase\nagreements.\nHedge funds are privately owned institutional investment funds that generally have moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified levels of\nabsolute return regardless of overall market conditions, and generally have low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds\noften invest substantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, etc.) using a very broad range\nof trading activities to manage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect\nto market moves. Common groupings of hedge fund strategies include relative value, tactical, and event driven. Relative value strategies\ninclude arbitrage, when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achieving an immediate profit. Tactical\nstrategies often take long and short positions to reduce or eliminate overall market risks while seeking a particular investment opportunity.\nEvent strategy opportunities can evolve from specific company announcements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically have little\ncorrelation to overall market directional movements. Our hedge fund investments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-\nfunds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are valued based on net asset values (NAVs) calculated by each\nfund or general partner, as applicable, and we have the ability to redeem these investments at NAV.\nPrivate equity-like investment funds typically have low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint ventures that invest in\npools of capital invested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying investments include venture capital (early stage investing),\nbuyout, special situations, private debt, and private real estate investments. Private equity management firms typically acquire and then\nreorganize private companies to create increased long term value. Private equity-like funds usually have a limited life of approximately 10-15\nyears, and require a minimum investment commitment from their limited partners. Our private equity-like investments are made both directly\ninto funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad diversification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan\nholdings in private equity-like investments are valued using the value reported by the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and\nsignificant events through our reporting date. Values provided by the partnerships are primarily based on analysis of and judgments about the\nunderlying investments. Inputs to these valuations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations,\nand may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority of these private partnerships\nprovide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair valuation procedures consistent with applicable\naccounting standards.\nReal estate is composed of public holdings. Real estate investments in registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are\nclassified as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy.

These claims or proceedings can involve various types of parties, including governments, competitors, customers, suppliers,\nservice providers, licensees, employees, or shareholders, among others. These matters may involve patent infringement, antitrust, securities,\npricing, sales and marketing practices, environmental, commercial, contractual rights, licensing obligations, health and safety matters,\nconsumer fraud, employment matters, product liability and insurance coverage, among others. The resolution of these matters often\ndevelops over a long period of time and expectations can change as a result of new findings, rulings, appeals or settlement arrangements.\nLegal proceedings that are significant or that we believe could become significant or material are described below.\nWe believe the legal proceedings in which we are named as defendants are without merit and we are defending against them vigorously. It is\nnot possible to determine the final outcome of these matters, and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the\nrange of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters; however, we believe that the resolution of all such matters will\nnot have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results\nof operations in any one accounting period.\nLitigation accruals, environmental liabilities, and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and\nassets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. With respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us, we have\naccrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and reasonably estimable based on the information available to us.\nWe accrue for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We\nestimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected to\nbe incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when both probable and reasonably estimable.\nBecause of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of additional product liability\nand related claims in the future. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses\nfor all our currently and previously marketed products.\nPatent Litigation\nAlimta European Patent Litigation\nIn Europe, Alimta (pemetrexed) was protected by a patent through June 2021. A number of legal proceedings that were initiated prior to\npatent expiration are ongoing.\nEmgality Patent Litigation\nWe are a named defendant in litigation filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals International GMBH and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively,\nTeva) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a ruling that various claims in three different Teva patents would be\ninfringed by our launch and continued sales of Emgality for the prevention of migraine in adults.\nFollowing a trial, in November 2022, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Teva. The parties have filed post-trial motions on which the court will\nrule and then enter final judgment in the case. We intend to appeal the jury verdict if necessary. Pursuant to agreement by the parties, the\naward, if any, will not become due until completion of the appeal process. This matter is ongoing.\nIn June 2021, we were named as a defendant in a second litigation filed by Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts\nseeking a ruling that two of Teva's patents, which are directed toward use of the active ingredient in Emgality to treat migraine, would be\ninfringed by our continued sales of Emgality. We challenged these two patents by filing requests for Inter Partes Review with the Patent Trial\nand Appeal Board (PTAB) and in October 2022, the PTAB granted our requests.The corresponding district court litigation is stayed while this\nPTAB proceeding is ongoing.\n99", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4370, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cea81100-4285-465f-a812-94e481a8d586": {"__data__": {"id_": "cea81100-4285-465f-a812-94e481a8d586", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_99", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "6e034371223dd75a416dbca70bb647e076ba14b59a86c74820c70b5d50f2d455", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Jardiance Patent Litigation\nIn November 2018, Boehringer Ingelheim, our partner in marketing and development of Jardiance, initiated U.S. patent litigation in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement arising from submissions of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) by a\nnumber of generic companies seeking approval to market generic versions of Jardiance, Glyxambi, and Synjardy in accordance with the\nprocedures set out in the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). Particularly with respect\nto Jardiance, the generic companies' ANDAs seek approval to market generic versions of Jardiance prior to the expiration of the relevant\npatents, and allege that certain patents, including in some allegations the compound patent, are invalid or would not be infringed.

Without any admission of liability or wrongdoing, we and Novartis have agreed to mutual releases for past claims and mutual\ncovenants not to sue the other in relation to Taltz and the patents Novartis purchased from Genentech. This matter is closed.\nZyprexa Canada Patent Litigation\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, several generic companies in Canada challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound patent. In 2012, the\nCanadian Federal Court of Appeals denied our appeal of a lower court's decision that certain patent claims were invalid for lack of utility. In\n2013, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Pharmachem Inc. (collectively, Apotex) brought claims against us in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at\nToronto for damages related to our enforcement of the Zyprexa compound patent under Canadian regulations governing patented drugs.\nApotex seeks compensation based on novel legal theories under the Statute of Monopolies, Trademark Act, and common law. In March\n2021, the Ontario Superior Court granted our motion for summary judgment, thereby dismissing Apotex's case. Apotex appealed that ruling\nto the Court of Appeal for Ontario in April 2021. In August 2022, the Court dismissed the appeal and in October 2022, Apotex appealed the\ndecision. This matter is ongoing.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nByetta\u00ae Product Liability\nWe have been named as a defendant in over 500 Byetta product liability lawsuits in the U.S. that were first initiated in March 2009 and\ninvolved over 800 plaintiffs. These lawsuits have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions, including California state court\n(coordinated in Los Angeles County Superior Court), and various federal courts, the majority of which are coordinated in a multi-district\nlitigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The majority of these suits contained allegations that Byetta\ncaused or contributed to the plaintiffs' cancer (primarily pancreatic cancer or thyroid cancer). All of the MDL and state court lawsuits have\nbeen dismissed as of January 2023 and we consider these matters closed.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as \"Superfund,\" we have been\ndesignated as one of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites.

The lawsuit challenges HHS's December 30, 2020 advisory opinion stating that drug manufacturers are required to\ndeliver discounts under the 340B program to all contract pharmacies and HHS's Administrative Dispute Resolution regulations. We seek a\ndeclaratory judgment that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution, a preliminary injunction\nenjoining implementation of the administrative dispute resolution process created by defendants and, with it, their application of the advisory\nopinion, and other related relief. In March 2021, the court entered an order preliminarily enjoining the government's enforcement of the\nadministrative dispute resolution process against us. In May 2021, HRSA notified us that it determined that our policy was contrary to the\n340B statute. In response, in May 2021, we amended our complaint to bring claims related to HRSA's determination and filed a motion for\npreliminary injunction and temporary restraining order requesting that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana enjoin\ndefendants from taking any action against us relating to the 340B drug pricing program until after the court issues a final judgment on the\naforementioned litigation. In May 2021, the court denied our motion for a temporary restraining order but deferred resolution of our motion for\npreliminary injunction. In June 2021, the defendants withdrew the HHS December 30, 2020 advisory opinion. In July 2021, the court held oral\nargument on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, the defendants' motion to dismiss, and our motion for preliminary injunction\nrelated to HRSA's May 2021 enforcement letter. In October 2021, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and granted in part and\ndenied in part the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Both parties filed notices of appeal related to the court's summary judgment\norder. In October 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held oral argument. This matter is ongoing.\nIn January 2021, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, were named as a defendant in a petition currently pending before the\nHHS Administrative Dispute Resolution Panel. Petitioner seeks declaratory and other injunctive relief related to the 340B program. As\ndescribed above, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana has entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the government's\nenforcement of this administrative dispute resolution process against us.\nIn July 2021, we, along with Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC (Sanofi), Novo Nordisk Inc. (Novo Nordisk), and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP,\nwere named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York by Mosaic\nHealth, Inc. alleging antitrust and unjust enrichment claims related to the defendants' 340B distribution programs.

In May 2014, the Labor Court judge ruled against Lilly\nBrasil, ordering it to undertake several remedial and compensatory actions including health coverage for a class of individuals and certain of\ntheir children. In July 2018, the appeals court (TRT) generally affirmed our appeal of the Labor Court's ruling, which included a liquidated\naward of 300 million Brazilian reais, which, when adjusted for inflation and the addition of pre and post judgment interest using the current\nCentral Bank of Brazil's special system of clearance and custody rate, is approximately one billion Brazilian reais (approximately $184 million\nas of December 31, 2022). In August 2019, Lilly Brasil filed an appeal to the superior labor court (TST) and in June 2021, the TRT published\nits decision on the admissibility of Lilly Brasil's appeal, allowing the majority of the elements, which were allowed to proceed in June 2021;\nelements not proceeding are subject to an interlocutory appeal to the TST that was filed in June 2021. In September 2019, the TRT stayed a\nnumber of elements of its trial court decision pending the determination of Lilly Brasil's appeal to the TST.\nIn June 2019 and September 2020, the LPA filed applications in the Labor Court for enforcement of certain remedies granted by the TRT in\nits July 2018 decision, requested restrictions on Lilly Brasil\u2019s assets in Brazil, and required Lilly Brasil and Antibi\u00f3ticos do Brasil Ltda. (ABL) to\nsubmit a list of potential beneficiaries of the Public Civil Action. In July 2019, the Labor Court issued a ruling requiring a freeze of Lilly Brasil\u2019s\nimmovable property or, alternatively, a security deposit or lien of 500 million Brazilian reais, which ruling was subsequently limited in scope\nand the security was reduced to 100 million Brazilian reais. ABL and LPA appealed the June 2021 Labor Court ruling to the TST, which\nappeal is under review. The Labor Court is currently assessing the status of Lilly Brasil\u2019s and ABL\u2019s compliance with such portion of the July\n2018 TRT decision and an inspection in the industrial plant is expected. These matters are ongoing.\nIndividual Former Employee Litigation\nLilly Brasil is also named in various pending lawsuits filed in the Labor Court by individual former employees making related claims. These\nindividual lawsuits are at various stages in the litigation process.\nPuerto Rico Tax Matter\nIn May 2013, the Municipality of Carolina in Puerto Rico (Municipality) filed a lawsuit against us alleging noncompliance with respect to a\ncontract with the Municipality and seeking a declaratory judgment. In December 2020, the Puerto Rico Appellate Court (AP) reversed the\nsummary judgment previously granted by the Court of First Instance (CFI) in our favor, dismissing the Municipality's complaint in its entirety.\nThe AP remanded the case to the CFI for trial on the merits. The trial began in May 2022; however, the Municipality filed a new motion\nrequesting the CFI to award damages. The request was denied by the CFI in our favor and the Municipality filed for revision at the AP, which\nwe opposed, staying the case. In February 2023, the AP denied the Municipality's motion for revision. This matter is ongoing.\nAverage Manufacturer Price Litigation\nIn November 2014, we, along with another pharmaceutical manufacturer, were named as co-defendants in United States et al. ex rel.

A large portion of\nthese accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the\nproduct is covered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n \nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because\nof the subjectivity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate\naccrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by\nproduct as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in\npayment timing, an evaluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of\nproducts that are sold via Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. For Medicaid, there is\nsignificant complexity associated with calculating the legislated Medicaid rebates. Management utilizes employees\nwith legislative experience and knowledge in developing assumptions used to calculate Medicaid rebates.\nSimilarly, for Managed Care and Medicare, given variability in prescription drug costs, continued historical year\nover year increases in enrollees and variability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be\npredictive for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data\nanalysis with qualitative adjustments based upon current utilization.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our AuditWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the valuation\nof the sales rebate and discount liabilities. This included testing controls over management's review of the\nsignificant assumptions used to calculate the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate liabilities, including\nthe significant assumptions discussed above. This testing also included management's control to compare actual\nactivity to forecasted activity and controls to ensure the data used to evaluate the significant assumptions was\ncomplete and accurate.\n \nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating for reasonableness the significant assumptions in light\nof economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. Our testing involved assessing the historical\naccuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performing analytical\nprocedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves.\nAdditionally, our procedures included reviewing a sample of contracts, testing a sample of rebate payments and\ntesting the underlying data used in management's evaluation. For Medicaid, we involved our professionals with an\nunderstanding of the statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's\ncalculation methodologies with the applicable government regulations and policy. For Medicare we evaluated the\nreasonableness of assumptions made by management in estimating the Medicare coverage gap liability.\n109", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "124b1313-212a-4895-9328-04e098387897": {"__data__": {"id_": "124b1313-212a-4895-9328-04e098387897", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf_part_109", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/LILY_10K-Q3-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1819576, "creation_date": "2024-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-10"}, "hash": "f416d0062269fe7b46cecdd81fdb1349c7e42664af1c83adfefb0f648490c99e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Retirement Benefits - Valuation of Alternative Investments\nDescription of the\nMatterAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Benefit Plan Investments,\" the\nCompany's benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in\nrelationship to the respective liabilities. At December 31, 2022 the Company had $15,688.3 million in plan assets\nrelated to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50 percent of the total\npension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative\ninvestments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net\nasset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n \nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty\nof the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash\nflow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.\nAdditionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited\ninformation available to management at the time of valuation.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our AuditWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative\ninvestments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which\nincluded a comparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring of investment firms' valuation policies and\nprocedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n \nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and\nunderstanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's\nestimated fair values. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related\ninvestment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by\ncomparing actual activity to previous estimates.
