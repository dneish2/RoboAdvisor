Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution \nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.

Many of \nthe Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \nthe Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3657, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddfc9166-d970-4a58-bac1-25bab54c9e70": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddfc9166-d970-4a58-bac1-25bab54c9e70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "hash": "e1917866c2be0007efb1407dea7445b2ae2da3f62a2300568d23635a3ef0a9a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b228060-cf28-49f1-821a-c6b3363657ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "489635cf88c95621a28c78772c9e2eb9975d7f44f795d2dc2a4d4245285e2b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the \nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \nenvironment for all of its team members.

Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize \nfrom time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \nand adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, \npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition .\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including \nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher \ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely \naffect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.

Substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to \noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures \napply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply \nchain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, \nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s \noperations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and \ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company \nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If \ndisputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and \nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other \ninternational disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and \nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial \naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health \nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate \nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more \nfrequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and \ndeliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result \nin slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in \naffected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience \nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited \nsources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would \nexacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. \nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;

In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete \nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on \nits\u00a0 intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets.

In addition, some of the \nCompany\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.

The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new \ntechnologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective \nmanagement of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products \nin appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may \nhave quality or other defects or deficiencies.

The effects of global or regional \neconomic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition ,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain \ncomponents . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can \nmaterially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing \ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has \nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business \nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist \nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s \nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury.

From time to time, the Company has made \nchanges to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory \nrequirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives \nimpacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with \nby March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in \nchanges to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how \ndevelopers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes \ncould also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside \nof the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store \nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company \nearns on those sales, would decrease.

New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or \nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for \nthe Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and \nchanging laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. \nThese risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, \nincluding health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance \nwith applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not \nviolate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and \nregulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or \nno advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For \nexample, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company \nhas programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance \nthat such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s \nproducts could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose \nthe Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s \nbusiness.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals \nand initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other \ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals \nand initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that \nis outside the Company\u2019s control.

For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \nacquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost \nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that \ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be \nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a \nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are \nin place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company \nhas not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value \ncould result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5212, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8d5d077-318c-468e-b190-6dcfe4b0631e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8d5d077-318c-468e-b190-6dcfe4b0631e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "hash": "2f1ebe9ca48fbd0e87b6b5ffa406ea76c58e5298cfded1cd13dc42a83c4f4888", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not \ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \nCompany\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to \ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \ncomponents. As of September\u00a030, 2023 , the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \nnumber of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income \ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the \nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings \nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of \nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant \njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \noutcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the \nCompany\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of \noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating \nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \nexceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \nsubject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it \nto acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, \ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which \ncould have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.

(\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) \nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the \nCompany\u2019s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to \nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store \nReview Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting \ndevelopers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app \npurchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and \nEpic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied \nboth petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\u2019s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple\u2019s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc.

In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to \nthe United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC \nentered a limited exclusion order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with \nblood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the \nend of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to \nappeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth  quarter of 2023  that did not individually or in \nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results.

Reserves are adjusted \nconsidering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a \nmanner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of \nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio \nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase \nthe interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \ninstruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a030, 2023  and \nSeptember\u00a024, 2022  (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive InstrumentHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 \nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \nCompany\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \nvalues of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \nprohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 \nmillion and $1.0 billion as of September\u00a030, 2023  and September\u00a024, 2022 , respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying \nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \nCompany\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 26", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da52e0b3-83ab-45bd-ae95-cbb0850ac47e": {"__data__": {"id_": "da52e0b3-83ab-45bd-ae95-cbb0850ac47e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "hash": "41fa152ce1f1122ef1a467fe336ec34ac050110215ea7ebab11eb0c58402c984", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s \nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over \ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). \nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three  performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, \nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated \nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to \nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the \nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative \nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \nbased on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the \nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis \nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \nnet sales only the commission it retains.\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1acbb183-9d83-44bc-84a1-d16462dd75a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1acbb183-9d83-44bc-84a1-d16462dd75a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "hash": "1bc1ec9eea19a71e74253f3074c0680fab33b21e38810db927b1a9d2589ad118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Net sales disaggregated b y significant products  and services for 2023 , 2022  and 2021  were as follows (in millions):\n2023 2022 2021\niPhone (1)$ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 \nMac (1) 29,357  40,177  35,190 \niPad (1) 28,300  29,292  31,862 \nWearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845  41,241  38,367 \nServices (2) 85,200  78,129  68,425 \nTotal net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 \n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in \nthe sales price of the respective product.\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales includ e $8.2 billion  of revenue recognized in 2023  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a024, \n2022 , $7.5 billion  of revenue recognized in 2022  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a025, 2021 , and $6.7 \nbillion  of revenue recognized in 2021  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a026, 2020 .\nThe Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \nin Note 13, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data \u201d for 2023 , 2022  and 2021 , except in Greater China, where iPhone \nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023  and September\u00a024, 2022 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion  and $12.4\u00a0billion , \nrespectively.

The \nCompany classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument\u2019s underlying \ncontractual maturity date.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. \nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations \nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a \nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other \ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its \nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months .\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these \ninstruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\u00a030, 2023 , the maximum length of time over which the \nCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 19 \nyears .\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from \ncertain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by \nthe remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest \nrate swaps, options or other instruments.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from \ncertain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to \nthese vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these \ncomponents directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, \nthe Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are \nsold by the Company. As of September\u00a030, 2023 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of \ntotal vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the \nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated \nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion , plus interest of \n\u20ac1.2 billion . The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the \nEuropean Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, \n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a \nhearing was held on May 23, 2023.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nApple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \nand regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0relates to accounts or disclosures that are \nmaterial to the financial statements and (2)\u00a0 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a02, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4203, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffcf74d5-a428-4714-a184-ff1c7422a044": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffcf74d5-a428-4714-a184-ff1c7422a044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf_part_54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/davidneish/Workspace/DevZone/Robo_Advisor/data/company_reports/AAPL_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 714094, "creation_date": "2024-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-31"}, "hash": "7495b03e5bde173eef1e2e5d9c5f021e6092993cb5dc2221935ba826bfa4429f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Item 9.

The Company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s \ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
